Donald Trump Struggles and Seems Confused in 'Painful' Crypto Interview While Trying to Change Topics: ‘It's so important. It's crypto. It's AI.

- Donald Trump has struggled in a “painful” interview on cryptocurrency, repeatedly trying to change the topic. The former president discussed replacing the ‘old’ financial system with cryptocurrency during an X Spaces interview from Mar-A-Lago.

Trump, who recently revealed owning over $1 million in cryptocurrency and earning $300,000 from sales of branded Bibles, spoke to social media influencer Farokh Sarmad. When asked about the importance of America leading in crypto adoption, Trump replied: “It’s so important. It’s crypto. It’s AI. It’s so many other things. AI needs tremendous electricity capabilities beyond anything I ever heard.”

Trump pledged to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet” but admitted to needing guidance from his 18 year old son Barron, who was supposed to speak but went missing. “Barron knows so much about this,” said Trump. “Barron is a young guy. He’s got four wallets or something. I’m saying ‘explain this to me.’ He knows it so well. And Eric and Don. I have a lot of respect for them.”

When asked direct questions, Trump deftly switched the conversation to topics like AI needing electricity or China’s influence, reports the Express US. He even drew an analogy between cryptocurrency and language acquisition, citing his own family’s experience.

He said: “It’s sort of like a language. I have a beautiful granddaughter, Ivanka’s daughter, Arabella. She speaks perfect Chinese. Their other two children speak perfect Chinese. From a nanny who was from China.”

Trump didn’t hold back in criticising the current administration, branding the Biden/Harris team as “extremely hostile” towards crypto, despite having previously dismissed it as a scam himself. “My attitude is if we don’t do it, China will. We have to be the biggest and best,” Trump said.

He acknowledged the industry’s growing pains, saying: “The value of this whole thing is bigger than the top 20 corporations. The numbers are gigantic. It suffers from some credibility lapses. It’s very young and growing. If we don’t do it other countries will do it. We have the advantage because it’s me, I do believe in it.”

Critics were quick to respond to Trump’s comments, with one stating bluntly: “Trump doesn’t know a damn thing about crypto and it’s painfully obvious.” Another voiced their cynicism, saying: “If this whole Trump space is just crypto grifting after a 2nd assassination attempt is absolutely sad and pathetic.” A third chimed in with scepticism: “Let’s be honest Trump doesn’t even know what crypto is or why he’s being asked to shill it.”",T_Shurt,595

The SEC has also still not released any sort of rules on what they call ""crypto security assets"", and what separates them from non securities. For example, one could argue ETH has many of the same characteristics of many other tokens and schemes that the SEC has labeled as securities, yet it gets a free pass regardless. This is what I'm talking about when I say we need clear rules for the road. Developers and investors are completely flying blind, and that creates a chaotic and unsafe market in my opinion.

It would be a much better idea to regulate most cryptos as commodities under the CFTC, such as is lined out in the FIT21 bill.

This is so dishonest, the SEC couldn't even tell Coinbase what tokens they considered to be unregistered securities even after the Well's notice was sent and refused to answer their rules making request back in 2022. How was Coinbase ever possibly going to satisfy the SEC under these circumstances? Especially when some tokens like Eth aren't securities under the SECs eyes, but some are with very similar characteristics. I find it funny that you didn't respond to that part. Do you think obfuscating what is and isn't a security is protecting investors? 

And of course, this applies to the Ripple case as well. It's documented that their executives asked people high up at the SEC multiple times if they believed that they were selling unregistered securities, and they refused to answer.

The SEC has made it impossible for companies trying to work in good faith with regulators to follow the rules.

""Securities fall under the Howey Test""

Wow what a stellar insight, you must practice securities law/s

Assets can be packaged and sold as an investment contract(security), but that doesn't mean that the asset in of itself is a security(unless that you think orange groves are securities). 

The SECs broad legal theory that a token can be ""the embodiment of an investment contract"" is legally preposterous, and has already been succesfully challenged in court multiple times, rightfully so.

""CFTC and FTX"" 

Brother give me a break. You don't get to stand on your high horse and defend Gensler over the CFTC when Gensler miserably failed to stop FTXs collapse even after meeting with SBF multiple times and doing nothing. If anything Gensler and the SEC has proven time and time again that they are woefully unable to regulate crypto and that power should be delegated instead to the CFTC, especially since most crypto assets are commodities and not securities.",Lemon_Club,1

Do you think it serves the investing public that the SEC cannot tell anyone what makes a crypto asset like ETH perfectly legal and what makes one an unregistered security?

What is Coinbase supposed to do? Shut down it's entire multi billion dollar company because the SEC can't just plainly tell them what securities they think Coinbase is trading? 

Don't you think that if the SEC was operating in good faith allegiance under the law, that they would immediately tell these brokers and companies what they thought were unregistered securities? 

Do you think it makes for a safe market for investors and developers that the SEC cannot tell you what makes a crypto asset and an unregistered security?

And no, I am not parroting crypto talking points around securities, I am repeating the logic around the decisions made by federal judges in both SEC v Ripple and SEC v Binance. It is clear as day that crypto tokens in of themselves do not embody an investment contract just in the same way that orange groves in SEC v Howey don't in of themselves embody investment contracts, it is how an asset is packaged and sold that makes it a security. If I buy XRP on the open market, I am not buying equity in Ripple, nor does Ripple have any post purchase obligations towards me the buyer. I am simply buying a digital asset that fits neatly as a commodity that should be regulated under the CFTC.

Sometimes it's definitely malicious, but other times its just negligence. Imagine you're a journalist, assigned to crypto articles despite not being a web3 native yourself, and you need to write a bunch of articles. In most industries, it's pretty fair to just go see the social media posts with the most engagement to determine what people in the space are talking about.

Normally, it's not a big deal if, say, Kevin Hart was talking about watches, and a article is written about that, rather than finding the Swiss watch makers personal twitter account with 2k followers and following his personal thoughts. That's just business. But something about crypto makes this approach feel wrong. I want them talking about Vitalik's thoughts, or thoughts by people who co-wrote many of the EIPs. But people like Mark Cuban and Elon Musk straight up get wayy more engagement in their opinion posts, so their opinions get picked up for the articles.

This problem is also only going to get worse as we move further into the world of AI. We're starting to see AI written articles being sourced from popular Twitter threads and such. The quality journalism that hunts down sources and gets the niche stories hand curated for communities are going to become even more rare.",SunliMin,1

Republicans don't criticize Trump at all. At least not in the house and senate, on the campaign trail they will but once it comes to him being the nominee we'll then everyone falls in line behind whatever he says.
So if the Republicans co trolled the house and senate then they wouldn't oppose Trump on anything. Which would be giving him dictatorial powers.
We see this all the time. Dictators don't become dictators until they are. Caesar was the leader of the senate until he destroyed the senate. Hitler was voted in and then took away the power to have him removed.

Edit;

I misspoke. Let me take a good look. This is exactly what I am trying to achieve but from a different angle.

My thinking is megga corps and billionaires after attaining lots of money that is more than enough to live a 100 lifetimes, continue mealy for bragging rights of ""I have a bigger number than you and therefore, I'ms a-smarter than any of you mugs"" Thinking. 

My angle is create successful businesses and keep 25% of the profits. (will explain) Pay either minimum or slightly higher than industry standard for position . ASIDE from executives! Min+full share. wage+ a full share. When possible, provide housing at cost+25% of net. Ca lling partners and residents Partner, co-owners. The reason for the 25% the shear need for incentive. It is their baby and they are proud. Deserving of the accolades and recognition of succeeding. You and I are only learning how rough a road this less traveled path is. And for good reason. This is not even the hardest part. Wait until the lean years when we are toaty burnt and wanting to crawl in a bottle and take up residence. (hehe. Don't ask me how I know. mega Snork)

Instead od trying to make it on Forbes 500 and having a big number of cash.

Intice people to want to prove their worth and have a list of business owners with the 500 highest number of partners. ***Partners 500***

Incredibly frustrating. My thing is a boat. Mainly designed for search and rescue. But it is just a boat and could be used for whatever with a little adaptation. So, I was marketing like a Swiss army knife of a product. Yesterday I was convinced during a conference call that I wasn't focused enough on one thing. That I was more trying to storm the country rather than the beachhead. And that is with one market and one product. And the submarket that was chosen, is the smallest of any of the portions of that pie of end consumers! LoL (that really is killing me)

Your incredibly ambitious concept is awesome and a manifesto of a plan.

I'd really and strongly suggest climbing the mountain by taking one small, first step. Once that foot is firmly planted, lift the other and prepare to take another step.

Perhaps some ways to do this is to find startups with the same goals and who would like to join in your end goals and product idea?

The issues you are addressing are huge and long-standing. It is gonna take a long time to convince people that the very frightening change is inevitable but one way or another has to come. Imagine Americans crossing the northern border to escape violence, food insecurity, and social decline.

EDIT;

Just realized. In my long term thing is to create a social fenominim where companies instead of trying to get on forbs 500. They try and get on the list of the top 500 people who have the most partners. In my concept/goal, a ""partner"" is an employee and or tenant. As part of the coalition, rent is a persons portion of the bills for an apartment building. An employee partner gets their pay and a share of the profits after the 25% going to the founder.

If you don't know the radio people. (If you do, ignore most of my ramble)

Find every example of whoever is going to interview you and try and figure out what type of questions you will be asked. Does s/he hate anything like this and going to ""gotcha"" you. Be sure they are on your side. If not, be prepared. So it is still a good thing for you.

Practice it and don't wing it. Do zoom with a pretend or actual person and ask them to ask you questions of their choice unknown to you. So you get thinking on your feet under pressure, practice.

A good microphone makes a huge difference. The tiny PC one's sound like your far away, wimpy and small. A good mic, not expensive. sounds way better and you won't lose listeners due to poor sound quality.

Humans and Neanderthals. Royalty and Surfs. 5 U.S. presidents were appointed by the electoral college, who lost the popular vote and election. Every store, restaurant

 Just woke with a thought. I must have skimmed this and not remembered. Or just happened to be thinking about in sleep mode. But the power and draw is always the money. The big goal is the exit strategy of going public and raising crazy amounts of cash. And then the monster is born. The corporation and legal persona do not care about anyone except itself and the shareholders. Each store, coffee shop, oil change place can make little and it stays open and destroys small, sole (Soul) proprietor shops and establishments. It has to feed the shareholders.

What I am thinking, instead of companies going public and selling shares. Later to become obtained by a conglomerate.  Mom and Pop places, to raise capital, join a publicly funded, open the public, co-op. For lack of a better word. Akin to what you're doing only a loose union of businesses and small investors. People who invest at the $5 level and own a piece.

A communal and caring form of a stock market ""whose"" goal is to enhance the life of all. Where a company is beholding to its people, customers, and communities.",Danny3xd1,1

Edit;

I misspoke. Let me take a good look. This is exactly what I am trying to achieve but from a different angle.

My thinking is megga corps and billionaires after attaining lots of money that is more than enough to live a 100 lifetimes, continue mealy for bragging rights of ""I have a bigger number than you and therefore, I'ms a-smarter than any of you mugs"" Thinking. 

My angle is create successful businesses and keep 25% of the profits. (will explain) Pay either minimum or slightly higher than industry standard for position . ASIDE from executives! Min+full share. wage+ a full share. When possible, provide housing at cost+25% of net. Ca lling partners and residents Partner, co-owners. The reason for the 25% the shear need for incentive. It is their baby and they are proud. Deserving of the accolades and recognition of succeeding. You and I are only learning how rough a road this less traveled path is. And for good reason. This is not even the hardest part. Wait until the lean years when we are toaty burnt and wanting to crawl in a bottle and take up residence. (hehe. Don't ask me how I know. mega Snork)

Instead od trying to make it on Forbes 500 and having a big number of cash.

Intice people to want to prove their worth and have a list of business owners with the 500 highest number of partners. ***Partners 500***

I agree. 

Ever notice how all the countries that are socially and economically higher on the ""Happiest countries"" lists have more social leaning? Not Soviet style totalitarian. But EU countries that care about people first. [In America, corporations are people](https://www.bing.com/search?q=In+America%2C+corporations+are+people&cvid=3bd0aa6f2aea48d29b7fd2f96fd23614&aqs=edge..69i57j0l8.1715j0j9&FORM=ANAB01&PC=U531).

Seriously. Revolutionary ideas are always uphill, all the way Especially when challenging the status quo.  

Edit;

I misspoke. Let me take a good look. This is exactly what I am trying to achieve but from a different angle.

My thinking is megga corps and billionaires after attaining lots of money that is more than enough to live a 100 lifetimes, continue mealy for bragging rights of ""I have a bigger number than you and therefore, I'ms a-smarter than any of you mugs"" Thinking. 

My angle is create successful businesses and keep 25% of the profits. (will explain) Pay either minimum or slightly higher than industry standard for position . ASIDE from executives! Min+full share. wage+ a full share. When possible, provide housing at cost+25% of net. Ca lling partners and residents Partner, co-owners. The reason for the 25% the shear need for incentive. It is their baby and they are proud. Deserving of the accolades and recognition of succeeding. You and I are only learning how rough a road this less traveled path is. And for good reason. This is not even the hardest part. Wait until the lean years when we are toaty burnt and wanting to crawl in a bottle and take up residence. (hehe. Don't ask me how I know. mega Snork)

Instead od trying to make it on Forbes 500 and having a big number of cash.

Intice people to want to prove their worth and have a list of business owners with the 500 highest number of partners. ***Partners 500***

I'd really and strongly suggest climbing the mountain by taking one small, first step. Once that foot is firmly planted, lift the other and prepare to take another step.

Perhaps some ways to do this is to find startups with the same goals and who would like to join in your end goals and product idea?

The issues you are addressing are huge and long-standing. It is gonna take a long time to convince people that the very frightening change is inevitable but one way or another has to come. Imagine Americans crossing the northern border to escape violence, food insecurity, and social decline.

I have to do a shark tank grant proposal and have been studying up on this. So take with a grain of salt. It is only academic for me.  (Be a great thread question here?)

If you don't know the radio people. (If you do, ignore most of my ramble)

Find every example of whoever is going to interview you and try and figure out what type of questions you will be asked. Does s/he hate anything like this and going to ""gotcha"" you. Be sure they are on your side. If not, be prepared. So it is still a good thing for you. It is awesome to watch, in this case listen, to someone attacked who comes back with great, calm and better answers to acusitory questions going on to win the debate!

Practice it and don't wing it. Do zoom with a pretend or actual person and ask them to ask you questions of their choice unknown to you. So you get thinking on your feet under pressure, practice.

A good microphone makes a huge difference. The tiny PC one's sound like your far away, wimpy and small. A good mic, not expensive. sounds way better and you won't lose listeners due to poor sound quality.

But again, this is just what I am reading, and I have yet to be in your shoes. So I could be full of it and talking out'a my hat. (very often the case)

If you don't know the radio people. (If you do, ignore most of my ramble)

Find every example of whoever is going to interview you and try and figure out what type of questions you will be asked. Does s/he hate anything like this and going to ""gotcha"" you. Be sure they are on your side. If not, be prepared. So it is still a good thing for you. It is awesome to watch, in this case listen, to someone attacked who comes back with great, calm and better answers to acusitory questions going on to win the debate!

Practice it and don't wing it. Do zoom with a pretend or actual person and ask them to ask you questions of their choice unknown to you. So you get thinking on your feet under pressure, practice.

A good microphone makes a huge difference. The tiny PC one's sound like your far away, wimpy and small. A good mic, not expensive. sounds way better and you won't lose listeners due to poor sound quality.

But again, this is just what I am reading, and I have yet to be in your shoes. So I could be full of it and talking out'a my hat. (very often the case)

 Just woke with a thought. I must have skimmed this and not remembered. Or just happened to be thinking about in sleep mode. But the power and draw is always the money. The big goal is the exit strategy of going public and raising crazy amounts of cash. And then the monster is born. The corporation and legal persona do not care about anyone except itself and the shareholders. Each store, coffee shop, oil change place can make little and it stays open and destroys small, sole (Soul) proprietor shops and establishments. It has to feed the shareholders.

What I am thinking, instead of companies going public and selling shares. Later to become obtained by a conglomerate.  Mom and Pop places, to raise capital, join a publicly funded, open the public, co-op. For lack of a better word. Akin to what you're doing only a loose union of businesses and small investors. People who invest at the $5 level and own a piece.

Incredibly frustrating. My thing is a boat. Mainly designed for search and rescue. But it is just a boat and could be used for whatever with a little adaptation. So, I was marketing like a Swiss army knife of a product. Yesterday I was convinced during a conference call that I wasn't focused enough on one thing. That I was more trying to storm the country rather than the beachhead. And that is with one market and one product. And the submarket that was chosen, is the smallest of any of the portions of that pie of end consumers! LoL (that really is killing me)

Your incredibly ambitious concept is awesome and a manifesto of a plan.

I'd really and strongly suggest climbing the mountain by taking one small, first step. Once that foot is firmly planted, lift the other and prepare to take another step.

Perhaps some ways to do this is to find startups with the same goals and who would like to join in your end goals and product idea?

The issues you are addressing are huge and long-standing. It is gonna take a long time to convince people that the very frightening change is inevitable but one way or another has to come. Imagine Americans crossing the northern border to escape violence, food insecurity, and social decline.

EDIT;

Just realized. In my long term thing is to create a social fenominim where companies instead of trying to get on forbs 500. They try and get on the list of the top 500 people who have the most partners. In my concept/goal, a ""partner"" is an employee and or tenant. As part of the coalition, rent is a persons portion of the bills for an apartment building. An employee partner gets their pay and a share of the profits after the 25% going to the founder. It could align with your end goal.",Danny3xd1,1

While coding in pine script is a pure masochistic experience, those rare moments when it works as expected, it works extremely well and blazingly fast, faster than any other platform I've tested so far. But in the end, TV's unreliable alerts make it impossible to use your pine script-coded algo with live trading -- one sell alert that TV did not send when it was supposed to and you're in deep red, so you'd have to babysit your TV 24/7 or move elsewhere... And no more way to automatically optimize strategy parameters is a deal breaker with any algo more complex than SMAs. TradingView cares about chart drawing tools like Apple cares about emojis, with no real progress made for algotrading in last several years of development.

Right now I'm testing QC, and this has been a insane experience... outdated documentation full of 404 pages, phased out parts of the platform with no replacement and no trace left anywhere apart from some old github issues, pieces are in C#, others are in Python, clunky website, etc.. Specifically -- local backtesting GUI you're searching for, they removed it from LEAN platform several months ago and haven't offered anything in return yet. Took me lots of googling just to piece this information together, like everyhting else about QC tbh. They pruned local GUI as they have plans to replace it with a paid module. I'm okay with paying for it, but why remove it before a replacement is ready? Blows me.

So right now it's either \`lean report\` or Quantconnect's painfully slow website, nothing that makes me excited really. Plus i'm a bit concerned about their live trading modules once my algo is ready, as so far I read in docs about some limitations like 20 alerts per hour.. really? I hope it can be overcome with local setup and code modifications.

On the positive site, I can see QC team is really commited to turining it into a great product, so I sincerely wish them luck and support them financially thru sponsorship and membership, as out of all devs out there looks like QC team really knows and cares about  algo and open source aspect of the platform.  I remember fixing bugs in Pine script with TV team... what a waste of time, as it still misses alerts. If it had open source code, there'a chance someone would've fixed it eventually.

Any platform that cannot offer a simple parameters optimisation or use already tested algo for live trading (or triggering alerts at the very least) is just a joke.

So, once again thanks for your list and whatever people offered in replies, I'll test other options, while keep grinding on QC tutorials, as there's lots of decent feedback online, but even more dead-end issues and questions in their forum, cause for concern really, but no real alternative so far, especially for MacOS/Linux,",Ok_Conclusion_2502,8

If I remember correctly you said you’re trading algo is in pinescript or typescript which is in the algorithm design world you may as well build you know windows out of silly putty and cellophane it’s those languages are not really well supported. What is supported is perhaps Java python And c.

**Original body text of u/twtchprme's post:**  

Problem: Hi guys, l'm M(23) and she's an F(24). Ldr kami ng gf ko. gusto ko lang itanong kung normal ba na mafeel ko na slightly naiinis ako sa mga workmates ng girlfriend ko na puro pangungulit sa gf ko na makipag-laro ng computer games sa kanila? Nung una, pinapadaan pa nila sa friend ng gf ko na babae rin na pinapaaya raw mag-laro knowing na may jowa 'yung gf ko and may jowa 'yung friends na lalake na nag-aaya sa kanya.
Kaya raw pinapaaya lang dun sa babae kasi baka magalit DAW ako and makita ng jowa nila. Binibigyan ko lang naman sila ng benefit of the doubt kasi baka naaamaze sila dahil malakas mag-laro 'yung gf ko.
Kaso ngayon, directly na sila nag-ppm sa jowa ko ngayon at nag-aaya ng laro. Hindi PA naman nirereplyan ng gf ko pero planning siya makipaglaro pag daw may free time. Normal lang ba nafefeel ko or immature ako? 🥲

What I've tried: I tried talking to her na isama niya ko if mag-lalaro siya pero she said she doesn't want me to join DAW sa certain game kasi ayaw niya mapunta sakin 'yung attention dahil masyado raw akong malakas. Pero may isang game anaman siya na willing ako isama to play with them. 'Yung reason niya is gusto lang niya raw na parang siya 'yung sumikat and mapatunayan na malakas siya sa harap nung mga lalake na 'yun which I totally understand naman. 

Advice I need: Any advice po? Gusto ko lang din malaman thoughts niyo hehe. thank you po!

It's better for OP to let her know what he wants or what he doesn't want, para iwas din resentment later. Ang iba Kasi sasabihin pabayaan lang ang gf or tatawagin pang insecure si OP.

Let’s break it down:

* **“Gusto lang niya sumikat and mapatunayan na malakas siya”** – Okay, flexing skills is cool and all, but why does it have to be in front of *those* guys? Are these dudes handing out esports contracts or just thirsty for some ""friendly matches""? Feels sus.
* **“Ayaw niya mapunta sakin ‘yung attention”** – My guy, you’re being sidelined like a benched rookie while the starters play. If she can’t let you join because *you’re too good*, what’s really stopping her from flexing with you there? Spoiler: nothing.
* **Them DMing her directly now?** – 🚩🚩Red flags flying higher than your ping in a bad server. They're *testing the waters*, bro, and the whole ""baka magalit daw ako"" excuse? That’s their guilt showing.

# What You Should Do:

1. **Communicate Calmly:** Tell her how you’re feeling—not to guilt-trip, but to set boundaries. Start with: *“Hey, I totally get that you want to showcase your skills, but it’s making me uncomfortable how those guys keep pushing for this. Can we talk about a middle ground?”*
2. **Evaluate the Dynamic:** If her *“I just want to impress them”* reasoning doesn’t sit right with you, that’s valid. You’re in a relationship, not a gaming competition.
3. **Set Expectations:** If she values these online bros over your comfort, maybe it’s time to reevaluate the scoreboard of your relationship. A partnership should prioritize mutual respect and boundaries.

TL;DR: You’re not immature—your feelings are valid. But if she’s not willing to adjust or compromise, maybe it’s time to question why you’re stuck in a spectator seat in this game called love.",Grouchy_Panda123,38

Ewan, pag sakin kasi, Una:  kung may tao man na hindi comfy yung partner ko don, I don't have any problem na dumistansya sa taong yun. Mas importante sakin mental and emotional security ng partner ko. Wala namang problema makipag laro. Kahit ako nakikipaglaro din. Pero sinasama ko talaga bf ko sa laro tas intentional kong hinaharot sa ingame chat kahit kasama yung random guy na nakakaparty ko sa laro. Okay lang makipag laro pero dapat may boundaries and umpisa pa lang ipapaalam na dapat sa other guy un para talagang durog completely kung may namumuo syang balak o intensyon. Kumbaga you're protecting na agad yung relationship nyo and may harang na for possible temptations. Tsaka ang pangit naman nung may kalaro yung gf mo na di man lang marunong rumespeto sayo as bf nung girl. Kung walang intensyon yan, ganon ba kahirap yung kahit papano makipag communicate sayo or like kahit papano tropahin ka, not necessarily ung as in tropa but like alam mo un ung casual buddy type na ""oy pre, blah blah""  like di ko maexplain pero naoobserve ko yan sa ibang lalaki eh yung cool na with respect approach sa kahit di nila kaclose na kapwa lalaki. 

Pangalawa: Di ko rin gets what's the point of looking good sa paningin ng ibang tao lalo pa sa paningin ng other opposite sex na di mo naman partner. Ano yun para pang boost ng ego? Pampaganda? Hindi ba dapat pag may partner ka, wala kang paki sa iba and di ka takot masaktan feelings ng iba para sa partner mo? Kasi at the end of the day, partner mo yung kasangga mo. Sya yung importante hindi ibang tao na wala namang ambag sa buhay mo. I'm not saying na maging rude sa iba para lng sa partner mo but like put boundaries and be direct sa iba kahit pa masaktan sila. Make your stance ganon. Kapag ba nabaliktad kayo ng sitwasyon na ayaw mo sya isama sa laro kasi gusto mo cool ka at hangaan ng ibang babae. Ano mararamdaman nya?",worriless_nie,6

Players of pvp gacha games tends to do everything they can to get the top monster/character. In the context of Axie Infinity, to get the best axie you either have to buy them or to breed them. This causes top players to hold on to their Axies since there is a chance that the  extra axies they have might become relevant when the meta shifts or might go to another to player that can beat them in pvp. This creates a free market of supply and demand in the Axie marketplace.

As for SLP, they are used to breed Axies however there is a limit to how much an axie can be breed and the SLP used increases exponentialy as an Axie is bred. This means that Axies with low breed count are more valuable since they are cheaper to breed however the quality of the offspring of two Axies is dependent on how pure or how good the parents are. Since purebreeds are very rare, this means that there are times that players will use a purebred with a high count to produce a good Axie. So breeders will buy/farm SLP to generate good axies that they can later sell or use for pvp. This also creates a freemarket for SLP.

Although it is true that influx of new players will influence the price of SLP due to increase demand due to the need to create new axies to sell to new players. Competitive gacha players won't have second thoughts on throwing money at the game to get the best team possible. As an example, Summoners War is a free to play pvp gacha game that generated 1 billion dollars in revenue in the span of three years due to players buying summoning packs to get the best team. If Axie Infinity garners the attention of this types of players, it can sustain its economy for quite sometime. However, it all depends on how the developers handle the game and make it competitive. If they don't treat it as a game and just as something to earn a buck then it won't last long.

As a disclaimer, I don't play Axie Infinity and have no plans to play it. This is just my observation from checking it out and looking into the economy of the game.",Plastic-Hunter-1395,49

The value of SLP is determined by how much the players value it. This means that to understand how much it is really worth we have to understand why players will value it hence its relationship to the gameplay perspective. If we are talking about how sustainable it is then it is important to talk about the gameplay itself. 

As of now breeders determine the value of SLP since they are the one usung it. As long as there are more breeders than those people that cash out SLP than it will maintain its price. However if the developers fail to nature the game properly then in game demand for SLP will decrease which means the price of SLP will decrease.

My comment is about how the price of SLP is not controlled by the developers directly but by how.much the players are using it as an in game currency. If the developers find more ways for players to burn SLP in game that would make them more competitive than the demand for it will be constant or even increase. I mean even today, breeders buy SLP to keep up with breeding and that is the main reason why SLP is high. It is not manipulated by the developers. Just like any crypto, it is determined by supply and demand.

Edit: It has to be noted that the price of Axies are also not determined by the developers, they are determined by the players since they are the ones selling it. So as long as the players find their Axie valuable the prices won't drop. Again just like any crypto. Comparing the game to a ponzi scheme due to this reason is kind of extreme. What OP has provided is just a surface analysis of the game.",Plastic-Hunter-1395,18

The value of an Axie can be determined in two ways, if it is a good breeder or a good battler (it might be possible to be both but I'm not sure since I don't play). 

For breeders, their main income source is from selling their Axies and breeding which requires SLP and AXS. Since there is currently no way to earn AXS in game, breeder would buy AXS using the SLP they earned in game. This creates a two fold demand for SLP to breeders, one for breeding itself and another for buying AXS. 

For battlers, they are used to gain additional SLP since PVE SLP gain is capped at 100 SLP per day. This means that the only way to get more SLP is to have a meta team. Since the only way to get a good Axies is by buying the Axies that are being sold it creates a demand for the Axies but it also creates a supply for SLP since the more people with meta teams, the more SLP will be in circulation.

Due to this reason there is a supply and demand chain between breeders and battlers which determine the price of Axies, SLP and AXS. For the game to survive, the developer has to find a way to balance the two out. Too many breeders will cause a flooding of Axies in the market which will decrease their price. This will lead to more people having access to meta teams which will cause an excess supply of SLP which will drive the price down. One way to aviod this is to keep the meta fresh so that people use different teams and buy new Axies. But if the meta becomes stale then there is no way but down.

That is why I'm saying an understanding of the gameplay and developer are needed to fully determine the sustainability of SLP. As of now based from what I've read, there is potential for the game to be good and competitive but it all depends on hownthe developers balance the game. If they treat it as just a way to earn and not as a game thebit will fail.",Plastic-Hunter-1395,12

I'm tying ETH into this because afaik it is the easiest/most reliable way to cash out from SLP without having to look for a buyer/breeder, which is why this is also a concern since ETH is more independent of AXS/SLP than the other way around.

Really it's all trading, but what determines AXS/SLP value besides supply/demand and movement/trading? Like if these were stocks, the value is somewhat determined by the company's success in its sales or investment portfolio(?), right? That's a big question mark for me that I can't easily find answer to, if such information is even publicly available

For breeding, Axies have a dominant and recessive genes that the parents pass down to child. For Axie's their appearance/parts determine their skills and stats. The chance of a child to gain a certain part is determined by the genes of parents. So high quality Axies with good genes are sought after by breeders especially since there is a limit to how many times you can breed an axie.

It is similar to pvp gacha games but not the same.

There are a lot of discussions and speculations about applying the NFT technology to gaming and Axie is an immature example of that application. People have been talking about NFT items in RPGs that can be sold in markets. In Axie Infinity, that item is equivalent to the Axie pets you get.

Now, this Axie however is an absolute overly hyped buttfucking Bullshit that is gonna explode right in the lazy Filipino peoples' faces, yes! that could only be the explanation why this is overly hyped in the Philippines, because mainly of Laziness. Laziness to do our research, laziness to have an actual job, or do the work, (which is very much highlighted here, can you see how they invented the term scholar, a term to pay people to the work/play for your game in order to earn.) goddamit. Also a Bubble is inevitable and I hope it does, or maybe not. We evaded the Global crisis back in 2008, but motherfucking shit arent we in global crisis even before that, so anyway.

Nobody even realize this, you convert whatever they call the token is called buttfucker token to ETH, and you have to go through so many mediums in order to convert the buttfucker potion to ETH which I would like to say is also very volatile and also the fees reducing what you earned through every transfer to another platform.

can you imagine a gold (and im being very generous here by comparing it to gold) you mined, distilled to so about 4 people who have a sandpaper brushing through every transfer just to convert it to actual cash?

That's how axie may earn, because axie community buy eth to buy slp to breed, and farm slp to trade.
The company profit from this, and that profit dictates slp value which they give you as a form of salary in which you'll trade.
And since it's centralized, it's managed/controlled/handled for good to ensure profit and the system won't break.

Instead of a trading platform, it's game based. 
They can earn in many ways. 
You funded them with money through buying a stock(axie), that fund may go to a large scale trading as well aside from earning via interest from circulating trade inside its own community or may go to other businesses which you'll gain a share of the profit because you bought a stock(axie).
And since you stored your money on them too, it may work like a bank that earns through interest from lending.

NFT will be revolutionary, as many non-traders will enter the crypto world to trade back and forth because of that, and it will affect the crypto value.

I don't believe it's a ponzi scheme. 
In ponzi scheme there's no circulating trade, they only pay the 1st batch through new comers' money. 
But in axie, there's a circulating trade within its own community. They have their own community.

I don't believe they earn through mining either. 
If so, that's a bonus.
This is not a free game, where you magically earn without spending. 
This is a paid game which works like investment. 
But instead of just sitting and doing nothing you're contributing to the circulating supply other than having stock.

Maybe y'all think where they magically get the money to pay their players, and that made y'all think it's ponzi or through mining. But No, there are lots of ways, since you funded them.",JuggernautFancy3003,3

However, I needed to make this switch because I'll be staying in the US for quite some time soon, and my friends told me that it's more convenient to have an iPhone there because of Apple Pay and iOS-exclusive apps that American folks use.

I've been on the iPhone for a couple weeks now and I also wanted to share my experience as an Android user all my life until now:

CONS (little things I miss in the Poco): 
1. No back button/gesture. On my Poco I could swipe from the left/right side of the screen to go back from virtually any screen but on iPhone the swipe from the left side to go back isn't supported by some apps, or if it is, it doesn't work flawlessly
2. Cannot switch between notifications and control panel with left/right swipe. I find myself still doing this with iPhone because it was such a convenient feature
3. No one-tap function to clear notifications (it's at least two taps on the iPhone and the button is a bit small that sometimes I don't find it right away)
4. No double tap anywhere to lock. I used AssistiveTouch instead and set it so that double tapping it locks the iPhone, but I would rather not have a circle floating around on my screen. I do have double tap to wake though! I disabled single tap/raise to wake because these unintentionally wake the phone. I also don't use tap back functions because these have been unreliable even on Poco.
5. This is very specific but it feels like my Huawei Watch GT3 has been draining battery faster when linked to iPhone. Not too big of a deal for now but it may be a way for Apple to get me to buy their watch someday lol
6. Cannot install paid/modded apps for free as I've been doing on Android for years
7. I also like the stock calculator on Poco better because it was easier to compute for bill splitting with discounts/extra charges.
8. No split screen. I rarely use this but it's convenient when I need it.
9. No subtle way of letting you know you have a notification. My past Android phones had a notification light, and Poco has the blue wave thing coming from the sides that doesn't wake up the entire screen. iPhone just lights the whole screen up which feels like a waste of battery and may be prone to mistouches in a tight pocket when there's a notification.
10. Cannot set my typing cursor on any part of a word by just tapping. On iPhone the typing cursor automatically goes at the start or end of a word and you need to long press to put it in the middle of the word which makes it less convenient to edit single letters. I end up just backspacing into the word because that's easier.
11. Less flexible volume control. Volume intervals are larger on iPhone and there's no separate volume control for alarms and media. I haven't played games on the iPhone so I didn't know about what OP said with silent mode.

PROS:
1. It may be because my Poco has aged and is already full of stuff but the iPhone is much less laggy with animations. Personally I don't notice the frame rate drops on iPhone, but the stutters on my Poco have started to bother me when I switch back and forth between it and iPhone.
2. iPhone appears to have better standby battery life (at least for now). My Poco drains a bit overnight and I find myself having to charge before leaving the house to make sure I have enough juice for the day.
3. Much, much better camera (but drains battery quickly with heavy use). Fantastic 3x portrait mode!
4. MagSafe! I have a thing for customizable modular components/accessories and MagSafe gives the iPhone that capability + the convenience of wireless charging.
5. More beautiful cases are made for iPhone - I just got this really cool mechanical clock circuit board case that I could not find for Poco F3, and in many instances before, I saw cases for iPhone that I wished were also available for Poco.
6. FaceID is more convenient (but I also miss being able to open my phone without my face right in front of it)
7. Bluetooth earphones sound better via AAC on iPhone. It seems that iOS does execute the AAC codec better than Android.
8. I don't need to keep clearing my open apps on iPhone like I do with Poco when it gets laggy. iOS appears to manage idle apps better.
9. iOS feels cleaner than Poco's OS (mainly because of the ads and uninstallable bloatware on Poco)

So far the experience has felt like an (expensive) upgrade for me, it may just take me more time to get used to the available/unavailable features. Poco is definitely still the better bang for buck, and I would choose it over iPhone if I weren't going to the US. Disclaimer though that the only other Apple product I own is an iPad from 2018 and I've never been fully immersed in the Apple ecosystem, which I believe is a reason many people go for the iPhone.",Far-Budget3421,6

Telefoanele fac ceea ce trebuie sa facă demult. Doar ca unii vor sa o facă și altfel. De aici și ideea de a customiza. 
Ca nu poți tu sa faci asta pentru ca ""îți pierzi timpul"" e altceva.
Îmi mențin părerea cu atehnicii pe aceasta ramura. Poți fi tehnic pe alta și sa nu îți placa să-ți bagi mâinile în telefoane. Exact pentru asta a fost creeat Apple. Să-și facă treaba și sa nu-ți bați capul.

Now I am thinking to switch in Android again, the reason why i switched to IOS it's because yun green line issue, hate that kasi di naman ako mayaman like every year can buy a new phone.

Gusto ko ulit i try si One plus 12 but the price is an OMG, yun Google Pixel naman I cant find anywhere else na may Installment then my last option is the S24U, but one thing that I am holding me back is currently I have an apple watch, yun lang naman nabili kong accessories from Apple, besides that wala naman na.

Just want to have an advise for unbias pov hehe

* If one reason for you to use IOS is the green/blue bubble. I can't really comment on that one, for my case kasi asawa ko lang kachat ko sa imessage ko no big deal lumipat.
* You said you like OP 12, maganda review nito this year, pero if you want something similar experience and medyo mas mura mura, baka pwede mo iconsider yung nothing phone 2, may bundle before yung digital walker na kasama na yung earphone, not sure if meron padin ngayon.
* For Google pixel, may available sa gameextreme, pero mahal ng patong nila kapag creditcard gamit and yung last inquire ko JP variant lang meron sila for GPP 8. One option is bili ka sa kimstore sa lazada then lazpaylater. Although I would advice buying na lapit na lumabas yung next, baka mas mag mura pa yan in the next few months.
* For watch concern, nag apple watch din ako and it's not for me since mas traditional watch guy ako haha.  Ano mostly gamit mong feature sa watch and anong watch?

Talking to Sumalee on approach:

>Sumalee: I read you, Risha. Captain--it's been too long. Republic High Command still talks about your defeat of the Voidwolf. Jealously, I might add.

>Smuggler: All they have to do is single-handedly take down an Imperial flagship, and they can join my club. I'll cut them a discount on membership dues.

Confronting some of the Womps:

>Pertamunk: You don't get to die easy. Not after what you did to my sweet boy Rance.

>Huntster(?): He was Pertamunk's husband-to-be. You took him from her. Now she's taking things from you. Starting with your teeth.

>Smuggler: Not only are you a bunch of Bothan-eating, Republic-raiding lunatics, but you marry your own relatives? That explains so much.

>Pertamunk: We were seventh cousins! Who are you to judge?

Discussion with yet another Womp:

>Womp: You! No... no! Where's Pertie? What did you do to my sister?

>Smuggler: Her heart really wasn't in the whole revenge thing. She's taking a job dancing on Hutta.

>Womp: Liar! She promised she wouldn't do that again!

Later in the same conversation:

>Womp: You heard Kashtinn. None of you gets to live in our space mansion until the captain and his little pet are dead.

>C2-N2: Pet? I am a starship steward utility droid of the finest-quality manufacture! Master, I require a weapon!

Honestly, I get the feeling the Voss might be the ones getting the vision of the cut content since they see Malgus awakening something. We don't have any details of what that is just yet, but I am not taking the Shrouded Ones off the table just yet. :P

>I've heard rumors that the Imp Makeb story was retooled from the IA plans. I don't really see any evidence of this in what you posted, but I guess it doesn't surprise me if it was a complete fabrication.

I think that conclusion was the result of several things being misinterpreted. The first is that if you only look at the cnv files, the only cnvs for Yavin IV are Imp side. So if Yavin IV was an Imp world arc only, then there would need to be a Pub counter-planet and the other three planets don't fit. However, as I noted, Yavin IV has creatures and quests for Pub side meaning that Makeb being Pub only would throw things off balance instead of evening things out.

Second, which I noted in the post is that there was a character named Colonel Niar in the Agent files and the Imp Makeb story has a character that shares the last name (although she originally had a different last name) making them think the two were the same character. So that combined with the planet arc having a secret agent feel probably just lead to them to make an assumption that does not appear to be supported since I don't think there are any other characters from the IA story that share names.

To be thorough, here is a full list of NPCs on IA Sleheyron and Open Worlds (I kind of doubt that Ziost would have had any plot similar to the ""we need to secretly not destroy the planet"").

* Sheheyron
   * Colonel Niar
   * Ghost Nine
   * Miora Gaitha
   * Oona Redd
   * Professor Redd
   * Ranvel Dren
   * Toloh Voh
   * Jervogga
   * Ardun Kothe
   * Echo Protocol Commander
   * Supreme Chancellor Saresh
* Open Worlds
   * Colonel Niar
   * Darth Marr
   * Professor Redd
   * Ocean
   * Administrator Ceica
   * Starhaven Security Droid
   * Ardun Kothe
   * Echo Protocol Computer
   * Mender Fifteen
   * Observer Four
   * Observer Six
   * Nexus (Shara Jenn)
   * Silka Nesh
   * Thren Valesh
   * Toloh Voh
   * Yfann Joor

Honestly looking at the NPC list again, I have to wonder if we might be dealing with a standard ""oh no they captured my grandfather who developed a superweapon and now I need you to save him super spy!"" plot with Oona Redd and Professor Redd, but I don't have any quests or dialogues on Sheheyron to work off of, so that is just wild speculation. Although you did go to Professor's Redd's bunker on Ziost for the Grandfather of Terror quest, so who knows.",Ranadiel,5

The general idea that any player would want to use any companion but the healing companion. I still cannot fathom why they thought we needed a ranged and melee tank companion. Playing as IA or Smugger sucked.

The Hero Engine was just not suitable for the game's purpose at all.

The massive amount of money used on VA's. Voice acting is awesome at all, but the scale they did it at was just not sustainable. They had their head in the clouds though, and thought they could make WoW levels of money. Despite having zero experience in the MMO industry. This STILL hurts the game's development to this day

They banned(suspended?) players for abusing slicing, which was actually just stealthed players no life grinding the resource nodes. Slicing credits was very quickly nerfed after launch, because I guess somehow they didn't think MMO players would no life grind things?

Literally the entirety of Ilum. A particular memory for me was the Imp side was so dominant they were straight up camping the Republic spawn, and the anti camp turrets were so weak they could just be healed through.

Melee companions lose a lot of uptime on heals as they'll move into melee position before casting anything.

Also the overworld used to be a lot harder. Players will obviously prefer not to stop and rest after every other mob pack. 

>The voice acting is great!...in theory. In practice, I do think they should have saved it for more important scenes.

I think doing it for the main stories was probably a good idea. They probably should have halved the number of characters though. The side quests though were just a bad idea. 

They were probably aiming to get all the Star Wars archetypes in, and I can see the all 4 tech classes having a place. Imo the two Jedi and Sith classes were superfluous, and I think the people developing the game thought so too since the idea wells for the casters run dry very quickly. Especially compared to their melee brethren.

I want to say Smuggler and BH should have been dropped since they're easily the least connected to their factions, but Smuggler really is one of my favorites, and I think whoever wrote it had a lot of fun doing so. Getting rid of the Trooper would just feel off though.

That's because early in development, the Smuggler and the Bounty Hunter were supposed to part of a third faction called Underworld that was neither Republic nor Empire. This was abandoned rather quickly though and they decided to align these classes with the two remaining factions based on Original Trilogy archetypes (Han Solo working for the Rebellion, Boba Fett working for the Empire).

One of the reasons why FFXIV still is around in the strength that it is, is that it plays and looks fundamentally different than WoW does and has completely different focusses set when it comes to endgame content.

SWtOR though, as much as I love the game still, plays (or played at the time) like a cheap WoW copy with more voice acting that ended up having no endgame because for some reason BioWare seems to have expected ppl to play the game like they would a singleplayer game.",DarkImpacT213,0

Thank you for sharing this deep-dive analysis of cut content in the files ! Cut content in this game always intrigues me, and the stuff from this era has always been interesting but I've only had a surface level understanding of what was planned such as the potential planets and more class stories, but I never knew they had planned this much out before scrapping it! I also didn't realize Makeb was around in this iteration of the cut content.

IIRC  during the 1.x era  there was datamining about Varl which seemed to have been scrapped for Makeb , and something about Rakata Prime/Lehon and the Dread Masters which seems like they reused that concept for the SoR flashpoint. 

This is so fascinating to read about all these vanilla class-story characters having more to do and the natural continuation of these stories feels like reading an alternate timeline, but it's also interesting to hear the parts that seem to have been re-worked into new stories like you've mentioned the Nul/force-sensitivity thread. Given that the story has gone in such a circle of back to Republic vs Empire with Vitiate gone, I wonder if Ziost could have more of this cut story if the world starts to get recolonized by the Empire and the Republic wants to pick a fight with their efforts like a flipside of Taris reconstruction, or to have some of these threads if they ever make Sleheyron or Bothawui into a zone.  I'm glad that a lot of the agent story seemed to influence what became Makeb's story, I loved Katha Niar's character in the finished product. 

I wonder if they could do something like class-specific stronghold unlocks with a bit of story like the Copero SH, to somewhat have some of these threads show up like the smuggler having a huge ship, the sith having a stronghold. 

And I think its been pointed out before but interesting to think that Sleheyron has been cut from kotor and swtor lol I hope it can make its way into the future story so we can explore it in the game environment. And I've always wanted to explore Bothawui at night ever since the Gnost-dural timeline video came out about the battle there.",Saf-ire,6

Varl was intended as a daily area before 2.0 (fourth quarterly updated), and Makeb appears to have always been intended as a part of 2.0. Looking at TORCommunity's list of what patches things were added, the Varl files we have were added in 1.4 while Makeb was being worked on in 1.3. So work on Makeb appears to predate Varl.

The Congos are around the middle ranking of countries by height, so I'm taking it as mostly accurate.  I looked at a few other countries and they also appeared to be around 170cm.  Obviously the inclusion of females would lower the average. But thats around 2000-2400 or an total average of 2200-2600.  Which includes the 2600 you say is 30% over.



edit: it should be noted that height/weight distribution does not completely correlate with wealth.   The average intake being the same as the average need means that there are those who get more than needed and those who get less than needed.",N/A,2

The Congos are around the middle ranking of countries by height, so I'm taking it as mostly accurate.  I looked at a few other countries and they also appeared to be around 170cm.  Obviously the inclusion of females would lower the average. But thats around 2000-2400 or an total average of 2200-2600.  Which includes the 2600 you say is 30% over.

The other question I had is that with the complete collapse of economic activity in Gaza and inaccessibility of most Gazans to their homes and valuables, how exactly are they supposed to afford private sector goods?  Is it actually making it to enough Gazans?

The Congos are around the middle ranking of countries by height, so I'm taking it as mostly accurate.  I looked at a few other countries and they also appeared to be around 170cm.  Obviously the inclusion of females would lower the average. But thats around 2000-2400 or an total average of 2200-2600.  Which includes the 2600 you say is 30% over.



edit: it should be noted that height/weight distribution does not completely correlate with wealth.   The average intake being the same as the average need means that there are those who get more than needed and those who get less than needed.",N/A,2

Acum vreun an jumate am aflat de NFT-uri cand a explodat povestea cu Beeple. Am un studio de design impreuna cu partenera mea si am zis ca ar fi interesant sa incercam si noi sa vindem ilustratii in spatiu.

Incetul cu incetul am intrat in lumea NFT-urilor si am fost din ce in ce mai dezgustati de cat de oportunista si lipsita de ""gust"" e industria. 99% din cei care chiar au facut bani in 2021 din NFT-uri au fost oameni care au zbierat pe Twitter ca vanzatorii ambulanti pe plaja.

Am creat o linie de 110 NFT-uri (in jur de 300 de ore de munca de ilustratie si copywriting - fiecare personaj are o poveste unica) pe care nu le-am lansat niciodata pentru ca nu am vrut sa avem de-a face cu oamenii din lumea asta. Pare ca cei care chiar ar fi interesati de arta creata de profesionisti care si-au dat interesul sa creeze ceva calitativ sunt mai putini decat numarul NFT-urilor pe care le creasem.

Fast forward to today, majoritatea celor cu care am colaborat sau interactionat in perioada aia sunt datori sau au iesit pe minus. Multi au avut caderi nervoase sau si-au strans jucariile si au disparut. Cunoastem un om care si-a vandut casa ca sa-si plateasca taxele pe banii pe care i-a facut anul trecut. Noi am avut noroc ca am vazut semnele toxicitatii din timp si voiam doar sa ne cream un confort financiar din care sa supravietuim, nu sa ne imbogatim peste noapte.

Predictia mea dupa 1 an petrecut printre crypto bros este ca nu o sa dispara nici NFT-urile, nici crypto-ul. O sa se stabilizeze intr-o oarecare masura si o sa devina o parte din viata de zi cu zi (cand si cum, fie ca NFT-urile o sa fie folosite ca certificari unice pentru sisteme alternative de invatamant sau ca o sa poti sa platesti la Mega cu Bitcoin, habar n-am). Pana atunci o sa fie mult hate, mult pe buna dreptate, pana dispar scammerii si oportunistii.

BTW, ca sa fie treaba treaba, ilustratia de la care pornisem colectia noastra venise de la un proiect unde clientul nu ne-a platit. Am sperat ca o sa ne recuperam din banii pierduti transformand-o in proiect NFT. Acum avem o gluma ca ilustratia aia e blestemata.

LE: Asta a fost doar perspectiva noastra, which admitedly is quite bleak. Exista si artisti care au vandut lucrari superbe pe platforme de NFTs, dar sunt clar exceptii, nu regula. Chiar ne-am bucurat pentru ei in cele cateva instante.",Gilgalin,93

Problema e la cei care folosesc un algoritm care generează PNG-urile alea random (mii de variații) și se îmbogățesc de pe urma lor. Și ar mai fi o problemă. NFT-urile de fapt sunt doar un link care duce la acel PNG și arată practic cine a cumpărat acel link. Ceea ce e cam departe de a cumpăra artă digitală cu tot cu copyright-uri.

Unde vad problema este in faptul ca peste 90% din aceste proiecte au fost facute pe genunchi, cu scopul clar de a imbogati creatorii, fara sa ofere celor care le-au cumparat un ""obiect"" de calitate, fie el creat si printr-un algoritm.

Iar despre copyright, eu vad mai mult NFTurile ca certificate de autenticitate. Drepturile de autor par mai putin importante, in detrimentul valorii aparente a proiectului in sine. Dar pot sa vad clar potentialul in a putea cumpara NFT-ul unei melodii ca sa o remixezi.

Investitie de viitor, raritate, bragging rights sau empatia catre mesajul transmis de piesa respectiva.

In mare nu conteaza ca e un jpg. Spre exemplu, noi uneori lucram si o saptamana la unul din aceste ""jpeguri"". Formatul nu il face mai putin valoros decat un oil on canvas. Numele celui care a creat piesa dicteaza mai mult valoarea.

Sunt multe de discutat aici si da, arta, in sine, nu are o valoare dependenta de functionalitate sau metrici clare. Dar, in acelasi timp, punem pret pe filme, actori, trupe, cantareti sau jocuri, care sunt forme de arta la fel de subiective. Clar, multe NFT-uri nu au valoare creativa, dar oamenii le-au cumparat pentru valoarea atribuita de comunitate prin interesul pe care l-au aratat. Then again, mie nu imi plac lucrarile lui Nicolae Grigorescu si totusi e destul de apreciat, asa ca pot sa ma insel din multe puncte de vedere.

Doar ca sa clarific, NFT nu este un jpg, ci este tranzactia unic identificata dintre 2 entitati. Asta face acel obiect 1 of a kind prin drumul tranzactilor sale, exact ca un cetificat de autenticitate. El poate fi pentru un jpeg, o melodie, un bilet sau o diploma de absolvire. Intamplarea face ca cea mai populara metoda de folosi NFTs este prin colectii de caractere, multe de calitate indoielnica (at best).

Edit: Am uitat sa mentionez, unele iteme din jocuri, gen skinuri pentru arme in CS, Rocket League, WoW (to name a few) se vand pentru mii de dolari. Valoarea lor e setata din 2 parametri, dupa cum vad eu lucrurile: raritatea artificiala impusa de creator (game company) si disponibilitatea userului de a plati pentru acel item.

Nu te supara, dar gresesti foarte grav - iti recomand sa citesti niste informatii absolut de baza in domeniul economiei. Incepe cu ""The Wealth of Nations"", a lui Adam Smith. De atunci s-au schimbat destule, dar multe principii raman valabile. In particular, Adam Smith explica (foarte pe larg) cum se creeaza valoarea, cum e distribuita, cum merge concurenta, relatia dintre munca si valoare si multe alte lucruri care au intrat in arsenalul de baza al stiintelor economice.

Ca sa raspund pe scurt intrebarii tale (si simplificand foarte tare), banii pe care ii iei de la munca provin din crearea unor bunuri, sau cresterea valorii bunurilor la care lucrezi. Daca esti de pilda tamplar, iei niste bucati de lemn care costa sa zicem un leu si faci din ele un scaun pe care poti sa-l vinzi pe zece lei. De unde vine diferenta de noua lei? Nu i-ai luat de la nimeni altcineva; ei provin din munca pe care ai depus-o ca sa transformi un lemn cu utilitate redusa intr-un scaun cu utilitate mare.",chatbotte,2

Cu unul din ei am facut cursuri de tranzactionare la bursa. Nu, nu m-a pacalit, m-am pacalit eu singura. 


Omul avea si roboti cu care tranzactiona. De la bun inceput ne-a zis ca nu exista imbogatire peste noapte, si sa uitam de chestia asta. A zis ca trebuie sa invatam constant si sa nu ne lasam dusi de val. A zis ca bula crypto se va sparge la un moment dat si nu cumva sa tinem de crypto pe termen lung. Il trata ca pe un instrument din care facea bani, si atat. 


Ce mi-a placut atunci, si apreciez si acuma, e ca inclusese in curs o parte de psihologie a tranzactionarii, in care iti exploca de starile prin care treci cand incepi sa faci bani, si ne spunea ca nu cumva sa ne pierdem capul. 


O data pe luna, chiar si dupa ce terminasem cursul, ma intreba de sanatate, el sau alt trainer, si trecea prin tranzactiile mele, certandu-ma la greseli si laudand reusitele. Chestia asta a durat cam un an. Tin minte ca m-a sunat si la mai mult de un an, sa ma intrebe cum sunt, si daca mai tranzactionez si sa am grija si toate alea. 


De doua ori pe saptamana facea sesiuni de zoom, unde analiza grafice si explica ce si cum s-a mai intamplat pe piata. Si acuma mai face, dar firma lui a fuzionat cu alta mai mare si nu mai face el analizele, le fac altii, de care nu m-am atasat in vreun fel. 


Acuma, cum m-am pacalit eu? Bagand 10.000, facand 40.000 din ei, si pierzand tot pentru ca m-am lacomit (chestie care a fost explicata la curs) pe o cadere prevazuta de el, cu cateva saptamani bune inainte.

Ne-a zis, tuturor, sa tranzactionam cu volume mici, sa diversificam portofoliul, si ca orice creste, la un moment dat va cadea. 

Cand a ajuns Bitcoin la 60,000 a zis ca el nu-l vede ajungand la 70,000, sa inchidem tranzactiile si sa ne luam banii si asta a fost. Normal ca nu am facut ce a zis el, ca doar suntem lacomi. 

Ne-a aratat cateva din conturile lui, si am vazut ca se poate castiga bani buni din asta. 

Era, si este, un om normal, despre care nu ai zice ca e atat de bogat, cu toate ca stiam cu totii ca e.

For instance, according to your site, Victoria VR has gone up over 11,000% since it went live on your exchange on December 2, 2021. The price is currently .3298. When I check Coinmarketcap, the lowest price for that asset in the last seven days is .226. That's an increase of only 31.47%.  Yet, the launch price you have for this asset is .000604. Even though I don't see how this could possibly be, because that asset was not that price on that day, 

How was this launching price determined. Is there some way retail investors can get this asset at this price ahead of it being listed on your exchange. I know about buying coins when they are very experimental and new from other exchanges, but that still doesn't explain how you were able to say that was the opening price on your exchange. It had to have been available through you or that price was never valid and the percentages you show for how much an asset has gained and lost are inaccurate.",InternationalAgent4,2

Tbf we *do* have violent patients in our PICU [psychiatric intensive care units] but they're medicated and in hospital gowns; it's just a matter of numbers to effectively hold patients down and get them restrained (either applying limb restraints so a nurse can administer an anti-psychotic, or just holding them down physically until the nurse administer an anti-psychotic) . 

The closest thing to a fight has been when person (COVID denier refusing to wear a mask and was asked to leave by receptionist) spit at me and thought that they can just stay for their appointment. We just ended up arresting him.

>Jeffrey Vanchiro, a popular Brooklyn Nets fan, died Sunday night from injuries he sustained when he jumped out of a second-story window at his father's house in Flushing, Queens, on Saturday night.

>Vanchiro, commonly known as Jeffrey Gamblero, was 38.

>Vanchiro, who was recently in the news after security removed him from Madison Square Garden without his prosthetic leg, sustained severe brain damage and a fractured spinal cord as a result of the fall, according to his fiancée, Kristi Evans.

>Vanchiro had been in the intensive care unit Sunday on a ventilator at New York Hospital Queens.

>Evans, in an interview earlier Sunday at the hospital, said she believed the Dec. 2 incident during a Nets-Knicks game at MSG changed Vanchiro for the worse.

>""After that, he was a completely different person,"" an emotional Evans said. ""He was paranoid. He was erratic. He was frightened. He was horrified. He was a bit delusional. And he was having a lot of trouble sleeping. He couldn't sleep at all. When he would sleep or try to sleep, it would only take about 10 to 15 minutes before he would wake up screaming, covered in sweat.""

>https://www.espn.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/12030579/brooklyn-nets-superfan-jeffrey-gamblero-dies-jump-window

Edit:  I initially said his psychological changes were due to landing on his head when thrown out, but I must have misremembered that because I can't find a source for that claim, just that it was a change due to the emotional distress of the ejection and how rough it was, it seems.  Edited so I'm not misinforming people!

Edit 2:  This paragraph says he hit his head when thrown out, but it doesn't suggest that was the cause of the psychological change so I dunno why I thought that:

>Security then picked up Vanchiro and removed him from the arena. Video shows him being dropped, which, according to Evans, caused his back to twist and his head to bump against the stairs several times. Vanchiro was then taken into the back of MSG, where he ""was so traumatized and bawling hysterically,"" according to Evans.",A_Polite_Noise,434

Footage of Los Angeles Clippers superfan Clipper Darrell getting knocked out by security guard at Crypto Arena,https://youtu.be/4UI0aGs-byY,ChristianMan710,1671048426.0,2171,"Apologies, I may have misinformed you:  I misremembered the part about it being due to a head injury I think, perhaps conflating all the articles talking about how the fall that killed him was a head injury.  I can't seem to find any articles saying he hit his head when MSG security tossed him out.

Rather, it seems it was either a purely psychological/emotional shift in him due to the stress and trauma of being thrown out without his prosthetic leg, *or* it was a change brought on from pain medication he was taking due to some bruises and injuries from being thrown out of MSG, but nothing says he hit his head.

Sorry again for initially misinforming you!  Still, it's still scary the idea that an intense and distressing situation could change you enough to do this, or that medication could, in two weeks.  Some more quotes from the article:

>Three days after the incident at MSG, Vanchiro remained distraught and said he wasn't feeling like himself. He thought he'd need until the All-Star break to return to normal.

>But Friday night in Brooklyn, Vanchiro was shown on the arena video boards dancing and enjoying himself. He later went to his fiancée's nightclub, but something wasn't right, Evans said. Still, Vanchiro danced a lot, and Evans figured it would relieve a lot of his stress.

>""If you try to stay the same after a life-changing event, then you're lying to yourself because when your life has changed you are now a different person,"" Vanchiro said Friday in an interview with OurBKSocial.com that was published to YouTube. ""I mean, I even got alter-egos going and stuff, but I'm not going to get into detail because the world's not ready for that.""

>""I had the worst week of my life,"" he continued. ""You guys don't understand, but I'm putting myself through the same training that I did when I lost my leg. When my leg got chopped off, I was [feeling] horror and trauma, and I had to focus on getting back to what I had to do.""

>The next day, Vanchiro went to a friend's house, then told Evans he was going to stay with his father, Sylvester, that night. Evans told him she thought it would be a good idea, so Vanchiro could get some peace of mind. But an hour and a half after Vanchiro arrived, Evans got a call from Sylvester saying Vanchiro had jumped out of a window.

>""He's never, ever exhibited any suicidal tendencies,"" Evans said. ""He jumped out of the bed, ran down the hallway ... and then threw himself out of a window headfirst and landed on his head.""

*If* this was caused by head trauma at MSG, it might be this part:

>Security then picked up Vanchiro and removed him from the arena. Video shows him being dropped, which, according to Evans, caused his back to twist and his head to bump against the stairs several times. Vanchiro was then taken into the back of MSG, where he ""was so traumatized and bawling hysterically,"" according to Evans.",A_Polite_Noise,86

This is targeting cryptocurrencies like Monero. Unless you have something more of substance than ""they secretly believe it's all cryptocurrencies and will illegally apply this law outside of the law's own specified boundary"", you are spreading dishonest journalism.

They defined what ""anonymity enhanced cryptocurrency"" means. That is what ""they"", the authors of the bill, think. It makes no sense to waltz around and say they don't actually think that, the bill is *legal text.* Their opinions are irrelevant, the only thing that matters is the contents of the bill. That is the law being proposed.

By no means is this bill to be dismissed, but you are not being honest about what it regulates. Yes, it's bad. But no, this bill is not ""as of tomorrow all cryptocurrencies are now banned!"" and you shouldn't go around saying that's what it is. If you think it's a stepping-stone, then say that.

A blatant exhibition of what you hope to achieve above all: fear. Not truth, or education.

>Further, it is deeply troubling that members of the Committee have been intentionally misled with incorrect data concerning the impact and purpose of S.2669. Our engagements with the proposal’s co-sponsors have revealed this disconcerting truth: many were surprised to learn of its far-reaching implications, including the potential to ban digital assets in the U.S. This revelation underscores the urgency of our plea: S.2669 is not worthy of consideration.

Your source still does not substantiate this. And ""well they're smart im sure they're right"" doesn't cut it. I'm not asking you to prove what the campaign thinks of this bill, That would be easy,  evident by you asking me to read Twitter as one of your auxiliary sources. I'm talking about the bill.

Anyway, our words weren't alarmism nor misinformation, it was largely repeating what the original letter said. Because of my critical oversight, I apologize for saying that because it was concretely incorrect and pretty rude.

>While presented as a proposal to safeguard against illicit finance, this legislation poses a clear and present danger to U.S. national security and the broader economy. Our concerns follow a careful and thoughtful cross-industry analysis. This bill, if passed, will erase hundreds of billions of dollars in value for U.S. start-ups and decimate the savings of countless Americans invested in this asset class legally. Furthermore, this bill will ensure we cede any remaining leadership position in the digital economy to China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, who are eagerly waiting to take advantage of the perceived willingness to abdicate such responsibility.

>S.2669 represents an effective prohibition on digital assets, setting forth compliance requirements that are not only impractical but also unattainable for organizations tasked with securing blockchain  
>  
>infrastructure. The legislation contradicts the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) 2019 guidelines, 1 which clearly define the roles within the digital currency.

The entire letter is strongly worded, but what is it *proving?* It claims that this regulation is a national security threat, particularly to Russia, Iran, North Korea. It claims it is a complete prohibition of all digital assets. It makes several claims. They might substantiate these further in person, but none of your sources (unless there is another! hyperlink I missed) include substantiations so I am not sure how the expectation is for people who believe it's not X, to believe it's X.

A stepping-stone should be accused of being a stepping-stone, not a prohibition bill. Either way, you are supposed to explain precisely why you think someone is wrong. I did this by citing the definitions and coverage of the bill and what I think they mean. You're not doing this by saying ""you're naive that's not what it means"" \[doesn't define it further\].

Ethereum was the only one who got it ""right""?   

Paypal is also clear.   Kraken got off by not doing third-party staking.  

BTC is  fine. Some other crypto is fine.

So it's clearly not all crypto. 

It's the folks who are trying to issue securities and pretend they aren't who are getting in trouble.  And some of them deserve it.    

And then there are the exchanges who are trying to trade securities in ways that make it possible to fleece consumers (and are therefore illegal for all securities, not just crypto).  For example, by having a trading house with visibility on the order book, and have trade execution be able to select its own trades as well as third party trades... 

It shouldn't be a surprise that if I can match a trade between my right and left pocket I can print any price I want without pricing risk, and if I can trade my left pocket with you to sell, and my right pocket with someone else to buy, I can arbitrage the two of you if there's enough spread, or I can just sit it out if there isn't.    An unregulated exchange is a recipe to make guaranteed profits. 

Until the exchange starts goosing its profits by taking risky positions and trades go against them... But even then, if they can dip into customers' assets they can bet to recover their losses... until they are on the losing side of too many in a row, and then they lose it all (FTX).",jps_,1

Uniswap purports to be decentralized yet it's not open source. I'm sure ETH people will say that they're all coincidental just like Clayton and Hinman were just coincidental.

 Ethereum is a scam from beginning to end, designed to circumvent US securities laws and enrich a small group over the whole market even at the expense of projects launched on the chain.

Ethereum premine was certainly a security.  but done in a way that SEC couldn't prosecute a person readily as the ""issuer"" - and furthermore, it appreciated significantly in value before SOL expired to bring charges on the ""issuance"".    That leaves trading in unregistered securities as an issue.

But ETH issued in POW is *not* a security.  And there is commingling.  So it's a complete mess to prosecute. And I mean ""complete"" mess.   This is by design.

E2A:  SOME ETH is a security. Some isn't.  That's why Gensler is stuck. One day they might want to prosecute someone who hasn't been clever.  They just don't want to do that, today... because it's just way too complicated for a jury to understand.  Let alone a thread full of crypto experts.

Now with POS, we may be back to security.   Again, by design (it seems that it was always intended to be a major gold-mine for the insiders, with just enough minted  through POW to make it a legal quagmire,  but not enough that the insiders would ever lose control before POW is launched, and nobody but insiders can afford to control the chain).

E2A:  My guess is that Ethereum is the one tackled last (by SEC), because it was so cleverly constructed.  Less cleverly constructed followers however are going to be pilloried in the process.  

But just because ETH may be free and clear from SEC, there's potentially a major surprise coming for ETH, because whoever is staking is clearly a member of the very large general partnership in control of its operation.  

Just because we can't tell for sure who all the participants are, ""distributed"" does not mean ""disorganized"".     The default *legal* structure for a group of distributed persons acting together for a common economic purpose is ""partnership"".   And it doesn't matter that we don't know who all of them are.  Courts solved the problem of people trying to disappear into a crowd long ago...  Nor does it matter where on the planet they are.  All lawyers need to do is find one of them, or enough of them with enough wealth to make it worth going after, plus a reasonable theory of damages... and then it sucks to be whoever they find.",jps_,2

Good citizen you say,https://i.redd.it/4rk7ni9zwxqc1.jpeg,IloveActionFigures,1711572900.0,7897,"This is what I hate about the refund policy on Steam. A fixed 2 hour try window and 14 day period is not a reliable system. 

And the biggest culprits of exploiting this are triple-A games and giant studios. Most AAA games will eat up so much of that first 2 hours before you get to even the first playable minute of the game. Some of the BS that these games will have :
1. shoehorned own launcher which serves literally zero purpose to the player
2. Anticheat that effectively works 2% of the time
3. insane first load times
4. No skipping of intro logos and legal disclaimer (especially rockstar games)
6. Migrain inducing long shader compilation
7. Oh look! A battlepass!
8. 5 different disclaimers and EULA, as if anyone purchasing your game who sat down to play, will read the entire fucking thesis of 300 pages 
9. Did you know you can spend even more money in game? See how many different ways we have implemented for you to seamlessly part your cash!
10. Intro video that goes on for far too long.
11. Non-interactive scripted sequence that goes on for far too long.
12. Exposition dump in readable text format!
13. An unskipable tutorial section, even on repeat playthrough.

and so on and so on.. 

By the time you are actually able to assess whether the game is worth your time or not, the 2 hour window is long gone.

Even if magically there was some way to start the session clock at precisely the right time of the actual gameplay start, so many AAA games have such a long playtime that 2 hours does not even begin to scratch the surface for them.

And then there's the unfortunate indie, and to some extent single-A and double-A games. Especially the handcrafted, bite sized, focused gems that go hard on quality over quantity, and ultimately pay the price for their honestly. Exploited by inhuman scums like the user in OP's post.

The tragedy of all of this is that Steam's refund policy is actually the most consumer oriented out of all the etailer platforms. At least we get an assessment window. Sony's refund policy on playstation is ""Oops! Did you download/boot up the game? No backsies!""

IMHO, an actually effective refund policy would be which would work for some percentage of time required to ""finish"" the game. e.g., if you play half an hour of A Short Hike, you have already completed like 25% of the game. But half an hour of, say, GTA V is like 2% of the game. The assessment window should be somewhat realistic like 10% of the game, or in practical reasoning, at least give something like 5 hours for games having 30-40 hours claiming. Additionally the evaluation period should increase to 30 days, not just 2 weeks. In all honesty, I would rather have a system like this even if it came at a 10-15% penalty for the transaction (refunding a 60$ game gives me back 50$), than the system we currently have.
I know this doesn't work for multiplayer or for infinitely replayable games or games which do not have a defined ending, but at the very least we need a starting point to ~improve~ frankly have an actual refund policy.",average_meme-enjoyer,15
Good citizen you say,https://i.redd.it/4rk7ni9zwxqc1.jpeg,IloveActionFigures,1711572900.0,7897,"It's a good system that puts player above publisher/developer. Games that have less than 2 hours of content are usually either bad (yet another asset flip horror game) or they have a price that fits that length. They also tend to have no piracy protection whatsoever. People who want to play them without paying will do just that, while others will accept them for what they are, it's a non-issue.

You could also argue for a more expanded evaluation period, but at that point you're actually misusing the system. It's there primarily to save people from buying things that barely work, or are so abysmally bad that you know you won't play further. 2 hours is usually enough for that, and Steam is known to refund past that window when there's a good reason.

Putting it at 10% of game time/content turns it into ""if I don't think it's good enough I will not pay for it"" and at that point, just go to a torrent instead of ""evaluating"" your purchase. There are already reviews, streams, user reviews, forums, etc. to ensure you make an informed purchase.",Gundroog,6
Good citizen you say,https://i.redd.it/4rk7ni9zwxqc1.jpeg,IloveActionFigures,1711572900.0,7897,"You’ve mentioned some cons but I’d like to point out others. How does one go assessing what a “standard” percentage for a game is? Publishers? Stream itself? Furthermore how can one accurately define what the set amount for X game is due to the fact that players play at different paces. This doesn’t apply to all games but for some it makes this system wonky.

For example an open world game like Elden Ring is a vastly different experience for different players. Some manage to beat the game in 60 hours and others take over 100 with a lot of players in between. How do you arbitrarily set a limit then?

I do think steam refund can do better and we should encourage it but I’m not sure if this is a good solution.",cyberjet,5

**New Voting and Reward System**
 
To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:
 
1. **Upvoting with Tips:**
   * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month.
   * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS.
   * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote.
2. **Weighted Votes:**
   * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance).
   * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0).
   * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight).
3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**
   * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count.
   * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments.
4. **Transparency:**
   * Tip records will look like this:
 
      `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`
 
**Guidelines:**
 
* Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation.
* As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially.
* Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action.
 
Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀",donut-bot,1

Where is it? The Public Key right? So a public key could be the address I use to transfer coins to Coinbase (address=public key in this specific case?). If so then the Ledger Nano has a address/public key specific to it right? And the coins are stored on it. And that address/public key never changes on the Ledger Nano device? If so, how does that device know there are coins linked? A battery? Surely not cause if they died it would erase the coins and they would be gone. So is that address stored by the Ledger company?

If I keep stocks in a fidelity brokerage account, I can be reasonably certain that fidelity is going to be around in 20-30 years. If someone hacks fidelity and steals all of their assets (oversimplifying, but for the sake of argument), my holdings are insured by the SIPC (at least, to a certain amount)

In crypto, I'm a lot less certain that coinbase won't have gone out of business in 20 years......and if they did, I'm not going to be checking crypto news every day for 20 years, there's a decent chance I just might straight-up miss news about it, and not do whatever I needed to do take ownership of my assets. Or if someone robs Coinbase HQ tomorrow and steals all the keys, that's not necessarily insured (some exchanges are, some aren't).

Of course, the danger with holding your keys yourself is that you lose them, or forget them, or someone throws out the hard drive they're on accidentally, or an exploit is found in the wallet software you used (like for example the parity multi-sig wallets) or your house is robbed -- in that case you are 100% responsible for the keys, and if you somehow lose them everything is just gone -- there's no password reset or whatever.",Hoeppelepoeppel,27

A 1oz gold bar is worth the same everywhere. But would you consider it the same security risk if you bury your gold bar or store it at your drug dealers place? Wherever you store it has its own security and it would be a good idea to do a bit of research into to find what works for you. Some exchanges for example are better then others for storage and have insurance but not all do.

 DYOR (do you own research) is a bit of a mantra around here and for good reason. Take what I say with a grain of salt and verify for yourself. Google different types of storage for crypto - pros and cons. Go down a few rabbit holes. Spread your wings, I believe in you.

Personally I like hardware wallets because if you triple check transfer details (which you should anyway) I feel they are the safest way to store crypto tokens. And if use an exchange even if It has insurance you can still lose it all. This is because you don't own your keys. NOT your keys NOT your wallet!

You're supposed to use an old laptop or purchase a cheap laptop.

You'll also need:

* Ubuntu Live ISO
*  A Flash Drive
* The latest bitcoin core wallet
* Pen and paper
* Lighter fluid and matches

Once you have all of that you then go to the middle of nowhere where there is no signal reception. 

Once you're there, remove the following from the laptop:

* Storage drives (HDD, SSD)
* WiFi radio
* Bluetooth radio
* Webcam & microphone unit

Then boot up Ubuntu live. Transfer bitcoin core files so that you can generate a BTC wallet address through the terminal. Encrypt it and write down your recovery phrase as well as your btc address. 

Once you're done, power down the laptop.

Douse the laptop with lighter fluid and light it up.

The problem is, even if the transfer to your wallet is free, when you later want to move them off your wallet, each of those $50/batches of bitcoin is going to be a separate input. All of those inputs have to be wrapped in the transaction, which is going to \*significantly\* increase your fee.

In most cases, it's much better to allow a portion to build up over time, and then transfer it once, if someone is DCAing small amounts.

Edit:

Here is a website you can play around with and change the number of inputs to see how it modifies the fee

There is ZERO legitimacy about this company.

Tell him to stop talking to whoever he is talking to immediately. Take a few minutes to breathe and double check everything.

I recall reading on r/Scams that a strategy like this worked for someone and they were able to at least get some money back from the scammers, because they got greedy and assumed that the victim was dumb enough to send more money if they provided them with ""proof"" that their funds were safe or whatever the reasoning was.

At this point, his best bet to get anything back is trying to do some social engineering on the scammers. Again, it's extremely unlikely, but if the scammer is greedy, they might be willing to send a small portion of that $200k back if they're convinced they'll get even more as a result.

When you want to withdraw money, they start demanding money to cover taxes on gains - and if you pay, they keep asking for more. 

They're playing on your desperation. Their game plan is to extract as much money as possible through ""fees"", until the victim finally realizes they've been scammed. That's when they simply stop communicating, and just take your principal as well.

I have never fallen for these, and I honestly don't know how people find these shady exchanges - I'm going to guess that they're either being shilled on various boards (crypto, FX, penny stocks, etc.), or google search is simply giving them exposure.",kastbort2021,2

It seemed like an obvious scam, but I entertained a few of them to try and figure out what the scam was.

The weird part is the scam never came, they could talk for fucking days without asking for anything, not even the most basic of personal information. For awhile all I could find on Google was a few reddit threads of also confused people, but finally found one where someone explained the scam.

They talk to you for sometimes months (likely weeding out anyone smelling the scam), before finally letting you in on some ""amazing investment opportunity"" if you just deposit on some crypto/forex/commodity site and then you see great returns on the account a bit after that, so they encourage you to add more.

Then you get a call from the FCA, police - some crime or regulatory body - saying they found you were a victim of fraud, caught the person and found the money. They need your ID, any personal info, and a payment from your bank account to prove its your money.

Second would probably be Seer. Know exactly where enemies are with his heartbeat sensor to make infiltration easy and if things get harry, throw down his ult to avoid enemies on your way out.   


&#x200B;

Honorable Mention:

Wraith - Her Portal would be great for getting in and out, though not being able to phase through doors would be a pretty big limitation here I imagine. 

Caustic - Why bother with stealth when you can just poison everyone. 

Bloodhound - Probably the best choice for actually tracking Hack down. 

Rev - Climbing for infiltration and death totem for when you need to bust some heads.",yourtypicalrogue,47

Tax laws vary between countries, so you may get more helpful replies if you specify the place you are asking about.

Please note that Rule #4 does not allow for Tax Evasion.  This is [a site wide rule](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) and [a subreddit rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/rules/).  Do not endorse, suggest, advocate, instruct others, or ask for help with tax evasion.  Do not be coy and sarcastically recommend against it or suggest using a privacy coin in response to an IRS inquiry.

Note:  Tax discussion is allowed as long as the above rules are not violated.

Just as a nominally representative government can overlook growing inequality, so too will ""representative"" crypto participants. I make that assertion because the largest blockchains are adopting technical variations of protocols which are known to be vulnerable to certain types of financial attacks and exploits.

PoW chains that depend on ASIC hardware to contribute mentionable hash power towards consensus can be viewed as very similar to an endorsement of a poll tax - a pre-qualifier to even be noticed in the ""conversation"" about consensus. Backing up the technology truck doesn't simplify or give us an automatic solution because the need for a microprocessor to hash and publicly validate a block of transactions is already explicit and not everyone has that in their possession. Humans individually tasked with the same mission cannot necessarily be trusted to reach a logical or valid or humane conclusion about historic transactions, but future generations can still look back to understand how we reached consensus and even what the ""wrong-thinkers"" were focused on.

The way history's transactions *have* been recorded ""off chain"", to this point, suggests a favoring of martial force over all knowledge and all other priorities - really the opposition to be juxtaposed against consensus, if we consider choices logically.  Transactions measure the victories and losses in conflicts also, with both winners and losers frequently indebted for generations.

And truly, what future generations have not had access to is the ""true cost"" of militarism and war.  The victors can often renegotiate debts with the spoils of their victims.  Win or lose, the costs and the lives are statistics to be debated judiciously while the powerful rarely are held personally accountable. When we think we are hearing the minority after a war, it's nearly axiomatic that we do not hear the marginalized, the imprisoned, the silenced and the forgotten. Their voices are not echoing in the debate or even present in the eventual consensus.

And yet, no matter how many 5-dollar-wrench threats are issued, the historical transactions of any metaphorical losers will be there for everyone to see and judge for themselves. The winners cannot erase the past of a public blockchain and just the process of eliminating nodes by force (as opposed to economic self-interest) implicitly ncreases the value of the blockchain's historical transactions. It validates why a distributed ledger exists. It is the audit trail that cannot be disappeared without powerful nodes taking notice.

Governments may escape accountability, but this really only means *individual people leading* governments may have no consequences. It does not mean the historical facts are misunderstood or the tabulations were wrong. And it does not limit our capacity to create new mechanisms that reflect a more representative consensus. Bitcoin and the blockchain projects which follow are both tools and experiments to have a non-sentient silicon-based infrastructure protecting our transaction history from being erased, no matter how insignificant it may appear to the powerful or to the future.

The potential is there for a truly dystopian world if participants are collectively greedy enough.  By that I just mean if we treat our public ledger the same way we treat our politics - as a cynical game where consensus is a joke, winners take all, and everybody believes it is corrupt - there is no referee to call the game because our team is in danger of forfeit.  It's public. Everyone already knows.  Hopefully we can *also* reach consensus on ways to avoid or replace corrupt agents in our governments that necessitated the inventions and experiments we are participating in now.",BsdFish8,2

As a 36 year old, the "".com"" is the issue and reminds me of the [Dot-com bubble](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble). See all the sports related things but notably 17 dot-com companies bought ad spots in Super Bowl XXXIV and those founded during the dot-com boom were:

* Computer.com purchased by Office Depot in 2000

* e1040.com went defunct

* Epidemic.com went defunct

* E-Stamp.com went defunct domain now goes to stamps.com

* HotJobs.com purchased by Yahoo! and later liquidated

* LastMinuteTravel.com merged with another company

* LifeMinders.com bought out in 2001

* Monster.com still around but bought out in 2016

* Netpliance bought out in 2003

* OurBeginning.com purchased in 2002

* Pets.com went defunct in 2000 and liquidated in 2001

* WebMD inquired by another company 2017.

Not many winners there. This doesn't factor:

* Insight.com Bowl founded in 1988 but the company is still around as Insight Enterprises.

* MicronPC.com Bowl lasted from 1995 till 2008

* Crucial.com Humanitarian Bowl the head company was founded in 1978 and still exists 

* galleryfurniture.com Bowl/EV1.net Houston Bowl",CTeam19,1

ABC had a streaming platform you could watch shows the next day on. That was how I watched the last few seasons of lost. NBC also had one. ABC sold the rights to lost off of their own platform. 

What actually happened as Netflix paid better than the alternatives for awhile. It wasn’t until others realized they could probably squeeze for the same margin as Netflix that they pulled. Most companies weren’t caught off guard by netflix, they just didn’t see the margins there. Hulu was also a player at the time but relying on ads. 

In general if we look at financial reports, the margins for streaming still aren’t actually there. They are going to squeeze the customers probably an additional 40-50% to really get to a healthy margin. That’s still coming. I think Amazon has already basically jumped that much",zaviex,10

Chuck has said recently that he will straight up retire if TNT loses the bidding war next year (for real).

The hospitals all used to be run by churches or charities (which is why so many of them have religious names).  It wasn't even that long ago -  I was born at a Catholic hospital in one of the largest cities in the country and I'm not a Boomer.  The first person I ever saw was literally a nun.  There was also a free hospital operated by the county but nobody went there because it was notoriously horrible.   Both police and fire departments evolved from a combination of private community volunteer organizations or even private companies like Pinkerton and even Wells Fargo.  We had all these things well before there was an income tax and well before we decided the government should do it all for us.  FedEx and UPS are widely recognized as doing a much better job than the Postal Service.  The power lines, phone lines, and cable TV infrastructure you use were also all built by private companies (unless you are in western Europe and then the US paid for it after they knocked down so much of the old stuff, but that was the governments' fault in the first place because they were doing what governments do best with your tax money).

[A couple of old saying that I have learned the hard way.   1) When you think you have the keys to the market, they will change the lock. - Act like you are not the expert and always keep learning.  2) Don't fight the FED. - FED has more money than you do. If FED is raising rates, the market will have a hard time going up. If FED is cutting, the market will act irrational.  At your age, you should think in decades. Buy slowly as market goes down. You will end up with lower average cost per share and then just hold long term as long as the company is doing well. If something major happens with the company than review why you bought and make adjustments.  Just my opinion, but AMD is a bit less risky. INTC is going though some major changes. If it works they will be a great company to hold. I like the new CEO but I am not sure if the rest of the company has changed enough yet.

[100% AMD has been kicking Intel's ass (badly).  I see huge opportunity for Intel on the fabrication side of chip making.   The only real competition is Taiwan Semi --- which is who everyone uses to make their chips, essentially.  Intel's fab plants are expected to be online in 2024 and, at that time, I would anticipate that they will have a lot of orders coming from the likes of Apple, Amazon, Google, etc...to make their chips.   Add in the fact that Intel finally has a CEO who knows the industry and I think the potential for them to regain their throne is palpable!  Ultimately, I don't think you can go wrong with AMD or INTEL, why? Because if you look at the world we are living in, there are going to be more and more chips that are necessary and the more chips and chipmakers, the merrier!](/r/stocks/comments/vc0izd/now_that_stocks_are_having_a_summer_sale_what_are/icbkczr/)

[Honestly for me one of the biggest bull indicators for Intel is Pat Gelsinger.  He stopped the share buyback program, heavily focused on investing in fabs, pushing for the US CHIPS act in which Intel will definitely be the main beneficiary, starting to open source chip design (following MSFT steps but in hardware) to allow companies to partner with Intel but Intel will benefit as they will have the capacity to produce the chips. He's also mentioned he wants intel to become more of a blend between a hardware and software company rather than mainly focusing on hardware, so if executed correctly, which I think he can, it could be a game changer for Intel.  Intel is still the leader in the market I'd say, they've been for decades and something like that doesn't just change overnight, even if AMD is making incredible strides.  Long term, I like it that Pat is focusing on investing in innovation and production, rather than just milking Intels cash flow to artificially boost the stock price.](/r/stocks/comments/vc0izd/now_that_stocks_are_having_a_summer_sale_what_are/icbpuhx/)

[> but their technology is severly behind AMD's.  I don't think that they are severely behind AMD. They are behind TSMC, but they also placed massive orders with TSMC so that issue could resolve itself. But even with AMD getting a big boost from TSMC tech they are only slightly ahead of Intel in most usecases or like you said, they are even slightly behind in some cases. AMD's lead is in part due to Intel's underinvestments over time, that's changing now with Intel making massive investments.   Intel is also still a cash cow and their net income per quarter still exceeds AMD's yearly net income.

[Nvidia mixes their gaming and crypto sales together and have basically been misreporting their earnings that way for a while now. So that’ll reflect poorly in oncoming earnings.   With ETH moving to POS, graphics power isn’t needed. And with the extreme fear in the crypto markets, miners for other coins like BTC are going to sell rigs in an effort to gain back capital and park it for later (mining may not be as profitable if coins continue to keep going down as they have over the past months). This floods the market with used cards, as we saw in 2018. Takes sales from manufacturers.   Nvidia is also facing increasing competition from AMD, recently lost the ARM deal, and supply chain issues in regards to silicon. With a global shortage, they’ll need voodoo magic to navigate a potentially oncoming recession without bleeding badly.   And ofc, there’s Apple. The M series chips are a threat to graphic card manufacturers as a whole. Mac users no longer have a need to buy GPUs from third party vendors. Windows and Linux become the only markets Nvidia and AMD can operate in, and with the rising trend of the younger generations who will enter the workforce in the future, Apple will gain a significant dominance over the future workforce generations. Mac preferability is growing, with Apple taking more marketshare from high-end users and Google chromebooks from the low-end.   Most younger generations use exclusively Apple products, and once they bring their Apple device favorability to the professional markets, Nvidia will be forced to focus on servers and data centers, as well as AI and autonomous vehicle ventures. With increasing regulatory concern regarding autonomous vehicles, there may be some scrutiny and potential roadblocks there too.](/r/stocks/comments/vc0izd/now_that_stocks_are_having_a_summer_sale_what_are/icbqybl/)

You may not be able to retire yet, but you’re likely getting close.   200 MSFT from ‘87 would be 57,600 shares today, worth $14,169,600, again ignoring dividends (which would be about $143,000/yr currently). Then again, you’d have lost about $6 million from the peak last year.   So you were “late” to the trade, but still did ok.

[Honestly for me one of the biggest bull indicators for Intel is Pat Gelsinger.  He stopped the share buyback program, heavily focused on investing in fabs, pushing for the US CHIPS act in which Intel will definitely be the main beneficiary, starting to open source chip design (following MSFT steps but in hardware) to allow companies to partner with Intel but Intel will benefit as they will have the capacity to produce the chips. He's also mentioned he wants intel to become more of a blend between a hardware and software company rather than mainly focusing on hardware, so if executed correctly, which I think he can, it could be a game changer for Intel.  Intel is still the leader in the market I'd say, they've been for decades and something like that doesn't just change overnight, even if AMD is making incredible strides.  Long term, I like it that Pat is focusing on investing in innovation and production, rather than just milking Intels cash flow to artificially boost the stock price.](/r/stocks/comments/vc0izd/now_that_stocks_are_having_a_summer_sale_what_are/icbpuhx/)

[If you're bullish, only 2 things I'd advise you to look at:  1. Oil for short term upside trades; I don't think we're near the top there and this selloff is all based on economic worries.  Feels a bit early for oil to hit a final cycle peak.  Past few days of selling is just panic. 2. Small caps for longer term trades.  Small cap aggregates are the cheapest they've been in decades.  S&P 600 P/E is nearly as low as it was in 2002.  IWM ratios look similar.  Obviously it's likely their earnings estimates need to come down, but the pain is already priced into small caps which didn't get a big bubble in 2021 like mega/large caps.  Small caps are overcorrecting here now while the large caps like AAPL, MSFT, and especially TSLA are just moving back down to fairer value.  Small caps are approaching historically cheap metrics here if the best price comparison is bottom of the tech bust (after which small caps dramatically outperformed large caps for 4-6 years).](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vdiewt/daily_discussion_thread_for_june_16_2022/icki8of/)

[ABNBs EV/FCF is pretty reasonable at around 20. The PE is higher mostly because of stock based compensation. Although arguably stock based comp is an employee expense, so I guess it depends on how you want to look at it.  Their gross margins are also extremely good at 80%. Their operating income would be 4x higher if you strip out their R&D expenses, but obviously they're investing in their tech which makes sense for a growing company so you probably wouldn't want them to do that.  My point is that they have the potential to be far more profitable than they currently are. They could easily achieve 40% operating profit margins which on current revs would probably mean the stock needs to be trading closer to $200. With a bit of rev growth on top of that it could be trading well above that in 5-10 years time.  There are risks with ABNB though. Personally I struggle with how strong their moat is. They have the brand recognition and the network effects in their favour which should make them a pretty safe bet, but other booking platforms could potentially enter the space and take market share from ABNB. Even a GOOG, AAPL or META, could potentially enter the space. GOOG and AAPL because of maps and META because of the P2P aspect of it. I'm also a little worried about regulation, but history would suggest investors worry too much about tech regulation. Regulation might increase their costs a little, but it's unlikely to prevent them trading out right. Regulation may also make it harder for competition to enter the space so it's not all bad.](/r/stocks/comments/vc0izd/now_that_stocks_are_having_a_summer_sale_what_are/icd69c6/)

The more they scale the higher the margins will be. This is obvious. Factor in gigacastings that reduce both machinery and human labor and input costs further decline. The 4680 cells also reduce costs via efficiency and structural battery pack but that's still ramping up and not factored into that 30% margin. Don't forget software that'll soon be realized profit. Conservatively, all of these are tailwinds which will at the very least support 30%.   Tesla isn't unionized and yet compensation packages are better than that of their Detroit alternatives. Not long ago Elon tweeted for the UAW to come visit Fremont and try to unionize. Bottom line, Tesla isn't concerned with unionization.   Speaking of legacy, don't forget Tesla has a direct to consumer model and doesn't have to carry the baggage of dealership models.   If you want to see how ICE are trying to navigate look no further than Ford. They're (rightfully) trying to separate ICE and bEV, including setting prices prior to shipping to dealerships. Farley is no idiot, he knows what's required to even catch up.  EDIT: The SP is being hammered by macro headwinds, as is everything non energy related.](/r/stocks/comments/vbvjrx/why_is_disney_doing_so_horrible_right_now/icgv41g/)

[Very true, point taken. Even Disney may be down that much, haven’t checked LOL. That’s valuations coming back to Earth and FB being a bit of an outlier due to negative sentiment (I consider it a bit of a value play and bought a bit at this price point by the way).  But absolutely, my point was mainly on overvaluation, which was (and still is) massive overall, but particularly so in growthy unprofitable businesses, simply because there are no earnings to provide a “floor”.   If Disney (or FB) goes to one dollar a share, all things being equal, I’m buying the shit out of it. If FuboTV goes to one dollar a share… well, how much is it worth really? There is no floor, no earnings, just prospects, growth, “future cash flows” who knows when.

Kind of like a Word document with all this information.

Other people on these markets buy these documents and then use the information in hopes of logging into bank accounts and steal money from people and do other things with online accounts.

These documents get old over time and become more available and sites like this are able to read them and then make their own lists based on emails of who’s had their info leaked.

This is why people recommend to not reuse the same password. Because once a hacker has your Yahoo email and password, they will then start going around trying to use that same login information elsewhere.

There are one time passcodes you can save to get you back into your accounts. LastPass has a backup to cloud but that concept seems sketchy to me 

The reason I say this is because if you do 2FA properly then it will not be possible to send an SMS code to unlock, which means if you upgrade your phone for example and forget to backup your codes you will get permanently locked out of those accounts

Ask me how I know, lol. 

Also, interestingly, fucking this up can shed some light on the security of the apps you are using. I had 2FA on some health/fitness app, and forgot to back it up, couldn’t get access, emailed support and they unlocked my account, WTF

So now I’m making a habit of pretending I lost my 2FA on my important accounts and seeing if I can get back into them through support, if you can then it’s pointless because the hackers can just unlock your account however the support team is doing it

You should have different email address. For example one for important services (bank, exchanges etc) or even one for each entity. 
You can then use other mails for less important stuff and a third one for useless sites that still requires you to provide a mIl or something.

Using a password manager (with the same rules as above) is also a good idea. You'll have different password for each site and secure password.

Using 2FA is also extremely recommended. To login into my bank account I need to confirm with my sms/mail/authenticator. 

Mail and phone 2fa are less secure that Google or Microsoft authenticator, that's something to remember. The best is sill to have a dedicated device. (Old phone or even a USB key you have to plug in). Make sure you have duplicate to avoid losing it.",Reanga87,2

With the sites that have it integrated, all you have to do is plug it in and it automatically gives the 1 time unique code to the site to allow login. With sites that don’t have it integrated, you’ll plug it into the app which then gives you a 1 time code to use within like 30 seconds.

You can solve hunger, global warming and pollution through this. 

Sea cage fishing solves world hunger and helps protect wild marine life, and you can reseed ocean with plankton and make artificial reefs. 

Kelp soaks up the excess nutrients and prevents side effects of farming. It also makes bioplastics solving solid waste. It also reduces ocean acidity. 

Kelp grows 9-12 feet a day and can soak a ton of CO2 which you can harvest for organic fertilizer, biofuel, food, bioplastics or just let it sink and take away CO2..  We can also engineer kelp to filter microplastics.

No, crypto is in fact helping to solve it.   


1.) PoW networks electrical usage is almost entirely due to mining nodes, for those running mining operations they have 3 major expenses.  Location, hardware and electricity.  Of these three the easiest one to reduce cost with is the electricity, and thus miners are highly incentivized to minimize to whatever extent possible their power cost.  This incentivizes not only using free renewable energy where possible, but drives innovation in and effort to reduce their power bill.  Short of starting a bombing campaign, the rest of the world can do little to stop China from making cheap power on the massive burning of coal fueled power plants to keep it's power cheap.  We aren't embargoing China in an effort to address the goods and products they manufacture using this cheap power, why is it only bitcoin that becomes a power usage issue?  


2.) Take all the banks in the world, all their daily power usage, all the carbon foot print of all the employees working for them going to work, in other words try and calculate the cost of our world wide financial infrastructure.  Then double or triple that to simulate extending that infrastructure to cover the entire world (which it doesn't currently do, but crypt does).  Never mind that international monetary transfers through the existing banking system can take weeks to settle, never mind that the laundering schemes of fiat are done through such banking systems, just taking into account the massive power and resource usage of this world wide system that doesn't even serve the whole world, and you'll find that crypto uses much less power for services provided than the banks.

I'm going to challenge this assertion. In my experience, there are virtually no ""climate change deniers"" other than a mere handful of loud ones.  Rather, people who don't accept whichever model/prediction is the model du jour get unfairly painted in this broad stroke as a denier.

One common phrase outside of reddit is ""Believe in climate change, don't believe in the models"", as up to this point every model or prediction of life in 2019, 2020, 2021 has failed.  I believe Al Gore famously predicted in 2004 that in 2014 the arctic ice caps would be gone.  They are not.

The planet has been warming up since the ice age. Yeah last decade or so it seems to speed up but thing like warming up usually are expansional, gaining momentum and then skyrocketing. 

Yeah the over fishing and pollution of the oceans is a problem. 

There are more trees now then there were 100 years ago. 

Main oxygen supply comes from micro organisms in the ocean and not the trees. 

Look at the things climate change policy has an affect on. Its mostly commodities and electricity. All mining is more expensive because of it, lumber prices soar like eagle because of it. Add that to corona lock downs destroying some of these companies life will just get more and more expensive. And who owns all these commodities and supply lines? Why would they want less competition? Why would they want to make complex regulations that are not just expensive but hard to follow if you’re a start up. Not just because of money and laws (permits etc) but also sentiment. Who is going to accept coalmines? Oil drilling etc. Yes we’re in transition but old fuels will still be needed for a long time. No competition leads to monopoly markets and then you can just set the price. A lot of old money is still heavily invested in oil and other fossil fuels and for good reason too. 

Renewable energy all sounds wonderful but we don’t know the impact it has. I live in the netherlands. People can’t just create large solar parks because it overloads the system. 

We build windturbines in the sea but research has shown that its very harmful for sea life. The sounds travel under water and create resonation that disturbs a lot of living things. Birds are constantly killed by turbines and now they’ve set up sound system that keeps birds away. Cool it keeps them away from the turbines etc but it also keeps them away from breeding grounds.

But here, you can easily check these facts: 
Basic stats (G700 Jet as an example)
Fuel capacity: 22407 litres
Max range: 13890 km
Fuel consumption: 1.61 l/km 
Maximum passenger capacity: 15


Fuel consumption per person: 0.107 l/km/person 

Now a car:
Average Fuel consumption: 0.094 l/km/person


However an airplane can travel in a more efficient path than a car because the car must follow the existing roads. This efficiency is >>1.3 in the states. As a result the maximum fuel consumption for a (full) private jet is 0.0823 which is lower than 0.094.
Fuck you for making me do basic math this late at night. And if you want imperial units…go back to 1800’s

He genuinely saw himself as equivalently committed to me so didn't see the point in a wedding, which can be expensive, so going through the practical reasons helped him (he's quite a literal person haha).

Mentioned Cohen in part 1:

Even if Adoboli didn’t read the papers, his coworkers might have seen articles at the time with titles like BusinessWeek’s “The Most Powerful Trader on Wall Street You've Never Heard Of”. Marcia Vickers opened with the line “Meet Steven Cohen...” and walked into a discussion of his “gunmetal-gray BMW slipping “out…\[his\] 14-acred walled estate \[in Connecticut\]...and into the parking lot of SAC Capital Advisors…”. Vickers wrote that it was a place where “SAC...sometimes orchestrates ""short squeezes,’...Sources familiar with the firm say SAC has never done this. Experts say the practice is legal.”

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for the upvotes and any apes reading the Adoboli saga! No lie, scanned/skimmed/read 100+ articles to make it so hope you apes like it!

EDIT 2: as a note, you'll notice all the Adoboli posts come off as a try-hard Michael Lewis impression heh

EDIT 3: yes thank you u/insolopia unfortunately I posted this here and elsewhere and triggered the ban so I am permabanned rn. I asked mods whether it can be undone but oh well, fingers crossed but thank you for the heads up! Hoping for the best! 🙏",throwawaylurker012,285

I don't really see anywhere that shows SUI having an edge, I don't care for the Electric Capital reports but even those show SOL with 3x the devs (based on github commits) but if you look more qualitatively, I'd say it would show even more of a lead for SOL.

Look at how many actual projects are being launch/completed. Maybe more devs are joining SUI, but unless it actually leads to something landing onchain, it means nothing.

That's why I prefer to look at hackathons or just how many popular apps the chains has already. And Solana has a shitload of popular apps and every hackathon has more submissions than the last.

Similar to how older people in the US prefer to stay in cash instead of stocks. My grandparents, in their 80s, keep 100% of their money in USD. A big chunk of it is in cash in a safe in their house and in a safe deposit box in the bank. Not only do they not trust stocks, they don't trust bank accounts.

Unless they had got cold feet and grabbed it out after a crash. Or the portfolio wasn't diversified enough and loads of it was in Enron. There's a million and one what ifs, some people don't want to play the game and it's very easy for us to sit in our ivory tower called the future and say ""well they should have just put 50% of it in a diversified portfolio"". The sensible move isn't always obvious at the time. We might still all end up with egg on our faces. 

Sounds like they've enjoyed their lives, lived within their means, raised a family and achieved the things important to them. This is not something to be taken for granted. And their lives wouldn't necessarily have been better if they'd have been a bit richer. 

An old work colleague's wife would take a portion of her pay and every year go and buy a couple of gold bracelets, ones she found aesthetically pleasing, but mainly for the weight in gold.

Some people just want to store any wealth theyve accumulated in the way they see as the safest.

They do have some technological innovations, things like the Shinkansen and the tech that support it like Suica. But generally my consensus outside of the bathroom is they lag behind. Even the robot café in Tokyo is mostly people dressed up in robot costumes lol. 

One thing I found interesting was almost everything you do in Japan requires a piece of paper/ticket/receipt - you cannot do anything without receiving something - which is lovely as a tourist - but in my mind it shows where they are in terms of old school methods of doing things. When I was there the only form of contactless they supported was Suica - which is cool in a sense - but means you can't use Apple Pay in stores - this may have changed since my visit though.",sh20,4

It's close enough that humanity can keep an eye on them, and they can receive shipments of weaponry and food from human industry in the area. Plus, the system aught to be utterly swarming with human-related activity including many armed vessels, so even if they and their ships' signatures were SOMEHOW picked out of it all, I wouldn't think Giznel would be dumb enough to send people into that meat grinder, and if he does, well, a fleet of Arxur Rebellion ships and their officers, very knowledgeable about the strengths and weaknesses of Arxur Dominion spacecraft, are a hop, skip, and a jump away from the shit show. 

Maybe I'm wrong, Giznel does seem the type to have an entire forest and more than his fair share of delusions of grandeur up his anal vent. It'd be dumb as hell, though, especially since they'd be fighting a two-front war, something Humanity reasonably wants to avoid.

Interceptors already have to be higher performance and faster than what they are intercepting, and weapons falling from orbit get to add 30 kilometers *per second* for free.

What's worse, is nukes fall apart when they are intercepted, but antimatter would explode right then and there. So you're not preventing anything, you're just causing a slightly higher airburst. With 20Mt warheads, it's entirely possible that you'd still see light damage on the ground even if you caught the warheads in the upper atmosphere.

The cold war interceptor system just flat out didn't work against peer threats. The United States could *almost definitely* block iran or north korea from trying something, but considering how much food aid we provide, it's clear nobody wants to even risk that.

Against a peer adversary? The system is designed to protect strategic bunkers and missile launch sites so they can launch a second strike. The rest of the country would be on their own.

Against orbital bombardment? well I'm sure the systems would do their best, but I wouldn't hope for much. Maybe they'd buy you thirty seconds before the interceptors ran out?",supersonicpotat0,18

One method is you blow a hole in the earth' magnetic feild, and over the course of a hour or so, it slowly closes. Moving magnetic feild lines create a aurora and induce current in anything passing through that part of the atmosphere. It's a longer lasting EMP. Look up Project Starfish.

But EMPs are also overstated. They knock out civilian electronics pretty well, but shielding against them is quite easy, you just have to be prepared.

Betterment will probably try to appeal to the ""traditional Arxur values"" or some other nonsense, insinuating that a real Arxur hunts their own meat or some such, and how not doing so makes you weak and complacent - oh just look at what those humans let prey do to their planet! Hopefully their grip is not nearly as tight as it's been suggested so far, or else - if this goes south - I can see Isif growing incredibly bitter about the UN.

People say that food scarcity often leads to rebellion - which is why I think it's so insane that betterment is actively thriving off of it. If this were so easy to use against them, why didn't some opportunist already try? Maybe there just hasn't been enough time yet for such a development, but maybe betterment has taken a leaf or two out of the federations handbook on control and Arxur psychology may not work quite as the UN imagines it does.",NeJin,18

# Who Art Thou? 

What up, some of y'all might recognize me, and for those of you who don't, I'm just a person who's vehemently against misinformation. You might have seen some of my posts and comments such as debunking Russian [disinformation being spread](https://archive.ph/Qe2rA) on the Lex Fridman podcast; pointing out the [misreporting in the Twitter Files](https://archive.ph/0rKku); or even a comment I addressed here where an individual tried to make the case that [""Israel has been siding with ISIS for years.""](https://archive.ph/KlMMs) In all of these cases, you'll hopefully notice the consistency in terms of my research, the diligence in providing ample citations, and the impartiality.  

I've also made attempts to improve the subreddit in general, highlighting the issue where people continuously [took screenshots of articles without posting sources](https://archive.ph/xBsb3); those who [abused the block feature](https://archive.ph/6VsL0) in order to craft their own echochambers; and the spread of misinformation.

---

# Prescriptions: The Six Points

**My argument is not that the misinformation is never addressed; it’s that it ought to happen sooner, and hopefully a post like this will incentivize that behaviour.** 

In order to do this, we ought to:

1. Value the process just as much — if not, more — than the conclusion. 

2. Be wary of how the presentation of information or the omission of pertinent information can lead to the inadvertent spread of misinformation.  

3. Be aware of how “charged” topics/threads lead to poor reasoning that lacks dispassionate analysis.  

4. Be aware of how pre-existing beliefs about an individual or organization alongside the usual biases leads to a reluctance to fact-check, where claims are taken at face-value because they *feel* right.  

5. Link the article. Read the article. (*Thoroughly.*)  

6. Redirect criticism to areas where it will be the strongest.   

---

# The Examples

This section will go through some examples where I personally addressed situations that did not adhere to the six points. Many of the examples cover several of these points, but I will only focus on demonstrating one of them. 

[Example 1:](https://archive.ph/f3UYX) OP wished to provide evidence of Pallywood (i.e., situations where Palestinians have faked their injuries). The issue is that they used misinformation to reach their conclusion, and they didn't consider this to be problem as the ""overall point"" was still correct. This in antithetical to [what Destiny advocates for:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE3RFkN4GEQ&t=1822s)

> Even if information did come out that all of the reporting ends up being not true, I still wouldn't give Ryan Grim any credit for it because you don't give people credit for being right or wrong, you give people credit for the process that they used.

Misinformation is misinformation. Per point 1, value the process. 

[Example 2:](https://archive.ph/qG3V8) OP provided a screenshot of a BBC YouTube title, stating: ""Israeli hit squad dressed as doctors kill Palestinians in hospital."" Per point 2, by failing to immediately link to [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kciGgyU2qRA), or immediately mention what the video contains, folk could come away with the conclusion that the BBC never reports that these were militants. In other words, some might believe that the misreporting here extends past the video title, when it does not, and this could be avoided by providing salient details sooner rather than later.

[Example 3:](https://archive.ph/ePfer) OP makes a series of false claims on a NYT article reporting on a UN report about the Oct. 7th sexual violence that had just been published. Considering the delicate subject matter, and per point 3, people were understandably charged when entering this thread, and that can lead to a flawed analysis. The prescription isn't to *not* be charged, but rather simply be aware of it, and hopefully that can lead to a more robust critique.

[Example 4:](https://archive.ph/srnjE) OP made the claim that Ilhan Omar denied the Armenian genocide. This claim was false, and per point 4, it was being upvoted because it *felt* true based on what readers knew about [Omar's unsavory past.](https://archive.ph/m6Wz2) Be cognizant of your own biases and how that can lead you to fall for misinformation. 

[Example 5:](https://archive.ph/mMRoc) An OP in another thread wished to provide evidence that former Hamas leader Khaled Mashal was worth $5bn. The issue is that, per point 5, the articles did not provide sufficient evidence of this, and they simply wrapped around to the same non-credible source. I decided to make a new submission on this when I saw a user was being heavily downvoted for correctly pointing this out. Don't be convinced that a claim is true merely because OP provides a ""link-dump."" Carefully read the articles and form your own conclusions.

[Example 6:](https://archive.ph/Pl95O) OP submitted a meme that leaves out Oxfam's full position on why they initially opposed airdrops in Gaza, choosing to focus on the most risible tweet. Per point 6, I attempted to redirect the criticism to where I feel it would be the strongest, engaging with the rest of the tweets, rather than selectively focusing on one tweet like people do to Destiny. 

Eventually, I was banned, and thus I have no more examples in terms of what I personally addressed. Before we get to some examples that others addressed in this period, I will re-emphasize an earlier point: 

**My argument is not that the misinformation is never addressed; it’s that it ought to happen sooner, and hopefully a post like this will incentivize that behaviour.** 

---

# Post-ban Examples

[Example A](https://archive.ph/X6TAf) demonstrates points 1, 3, 4, and 5. OP wished to highlight that they're skeptical about a [Haaretz article](https://archive.ph/7MMMD) talking about routine amputations on detained Gazans at an Israeli field hospital. While their conclusion about the article might have been correct, they made a series of misleading claims to reach there. Carefully read the article.

[Example B](https://archive.ph/svbgd) demonstrates points 2 and 3. The chaos of the campus protests has led to a charged atmosphere on the subreddit, which means that a post stating that a “Jewish-Israeli family’s restaurant was targeted in a hate crime” is taken to be a recent event; this resulted from OP omitting this information; and it took [nearly 10 hours](https://archive.ph/hLP4V) for the fact-check to arrive. Always ask OP for a source if none is provided, even if they grabbed it off Twitter.   

[Example C](https://archive.ph/a0THK) demonstrates points 1 and 5. OP wished to prove a claim that Destiny had tweeted. However, the sources OP provided were written in Hebrew; they did not quote from the sources; the sources provided did not demonstrate their claim; and they accused another individual of lying when they correctly pointed out OP's mistake. Even if OP happened to be correct in their conclusion, their process was flawed; and people clearly had not read the sources provided, upvoting based on vibes. As always, don't assume an individual's claim is correct merely because they provide a series of links. It can give the ""aura"" of being correct, and it's easy to be misled.

---

# Conclusion

Hopefully, I have demonstrated that while misinformation is undoubtedly addressed on this subreddit, it can take a while before the fact-checkers arrive. In that interval, misinformation is being spread, and some won't return to the thread to see the fact-check. In order to curb the likelihood this happens, we should try to be mindful of The Six Points.

---

# The Ban

I believe this section is warranted for three reasons: (1) I have exhausted all other avenues to get unbanned; (2) I am seeking clarification on what the violation was so that I can avoid replicating it in the future; and (3) I am seeking clarification, whether from Destiny or 4THOT, on whether or not there exists a procedure to get unbanned if 4THOT makes the unban dependent on some condition being met. As it stands, it doesn't seem to be the case that other moderators can override this condition, and it's also unclear if Destiny approves of these conditional bans. 

As for the possible violation, that can [be found here](https://archive.ph/UCc6j), where I had a different interpretation on what the beliefs of a UN Special Rapporteur were. I have been unable to figure out what violation occurred in my comment, and I can only speculate that the violation here is that the comment did not align with 4THOT's personal opinion on the matter. *If* that is the case, then I don't believe this is what Destiny had in mind in terms of how he would like the subreddit moderated. However, 4THOT has yet to articulate what the violation was, and it's possible that the moderation for this case is, in fact, congruent with what Destiny desires. 

It's often stated by both Destiny and [other moderators](https://archive.ph/ZptEm) that the ""process to get unbanned is pretty easy."" Conditional bans tarnish the smoothness of this process, where good-faith unban requests are rejected due to the condition set, and I don't believe this should be the case.

# Finito

In terms of the subreddit, I would say keep The Six Points in mind.

In terms of 4THOT and Destiny, I am seeking clarification here, and:

[Part 1][WARNING: Unnecessarily Long Effort-post] An analysis of the behaviour that leads to misinformation on the subreddit and in general; methods to curb this; and other malarkey.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1cq8tqu/part_1warning_unnecessarily_long_effortpost_an/,PoisonedWhispers,1715523320.0,946,"Hey, here's a tldr-tldr summary of your thesis you're welcome to use. Let me know if it captures the gist of what you're saying. It's split into 2 parts.

Diagnosis: this sub gets into misinformation about Israel-Palestine. Both sides of the conflict do it, and not to the same degree, but because of the pro-Israel influx of users that have entered the sub, you see it more on that side. It's more of a numbers phenomenon as opposed to intentional misinformation; it being part of an emotionally charged conflict, to boot, makes it worse. Worst yet, it's alarming that the sub focuses on being more informed than their opponent rather than being informed full-stop (a tendency that probably comes from a figure who's debate oriented).

Prescription: we have to care about the process more than the whether the conclusion happens to be right or not. It certainly can't be a team sports game where my figure/side ""pwned"" my opponents side, otherwise, we'd be fundamentally as bad as the idiotic illiberal extremists online that we oppose.

**The process is basically this:** for articles and Twitter links, we should have fuller immediate context for the incident. On top of that, we should also fit that into a broader contextual analysis (seeing the forest of the trees). Why do this you might ask? Because, braindead extremists on both sides do the opposite of this to attack moderate liberalism. Boomer Fox News MAGA supporters will find some clips of a blue haired girl and poorly executed liberal economic policies to push a grand narrative that liberalism is evil and bad. Far left Twitter users will find clips of liberals taken out of context that make them look bad (like Destiny), and instances of American foreign policy failures to push a false grand narrative. The M.O of both of these extremist sides is to unfairly strawman the moderate liberal thesis because that's all they have. They don't have real solutions to anything; their existence is solely to rile people up to boost their own personal clout or ego. If you hate all of that from those online extremists, then let's not turn into that.",ElectricalCamp104,7

They control everything and dont want a nuclear conflict. They also have tech that makes star trek look like sunday school. ie DEW and psychotronic weapons that can manipulate consciousness or produce any illness in a person, create super strength. All coordinated by an AI and more. Theres no need for a nuclear weapon when they can precisely and covertly destroy any individual or group of people in a way that seems natural/has plausible deniability while keeping their power structure in tact.

It would be very easy for this AI to read anyones brain on the planet and then mindcontrol them to not push the nuclear launch button. Even if it failed at that it could use DEW on the nuclear missile or bomb and basically destroy the arming mechanism or change the nuclear material into an innert substance. I think it is based around scalar wave manipulation combined with ELF.

Basically nuclear weapons are a sham and no longer needed because they could kill every man woman and child in an entire city instantly if they wanted to with absolute precision as to spare 10 or 20 individuals if they wanted in a way that seemed natural. ie 5000 or 25000 people all die suddenly from heart attacks or brain aneurysms.",Krelious,1

On November 22, 1996, the US Justice Department indicted General Ramón Guillén Davila of Venezuela on charges of importing cocaine into the United States. The federal prosecutors alleged that while heading Venezuela’s anti-drug unit, General Guillén smuggled more than 22 tons of cocaine into the US and Europe for the Calí and Bogotá cartels. Guillén responded to the indictment from the sanctuary of Caracas, whence his government refused to extradict him to Miami, while honoring him with a pardon for any possible crimes committed in the line of duty. He maintained that the cocaine shipments to the US had been approved by the CIA, and went on to say that “some drugs were lost and neither the CIA nor the DEA want to accept any responsibility for it.”

The CIA had hired Guillén in 1988 to help it find out something about the Colombian drug cartels. The Agency and Guillén set up a drug-smuggling operation using agents of Guillén’s in the Venezuelan National Guard to buy cocaine from the Calí cartel and ship it to Venezuela, where it was stored in warehouses maintained by the Narcotics Intelligence Center, Caracas, which was run by Guillén and entirely funded by the CIA.

To avoid the Calí cartel asking inconvenient questions about the growing inventory of cocaine in the Narcotics Intelligence Center’s warehouses and, as one CIA agent put it, “to keep our credibility with the traffickers,” the CIA decided it was politic to let some of the cocaine proceed on to the cartel’s network of dealers in the US. As another CIA agent put it, they wanted “to let the dope walk” – in other words, to allow it to be sold on the streets of Miami, New York and Los Angeles.

When it comes to what are called “controlled shipments” of drugs into the US, federal law requires that such imports have DEA approval, which the CIA duly sought. This was, however, denied by the DEA attaché in Caracas. The CIA then went to  DEA headquarters in Washington, only to be met with a similar refusal, whereupon the CIA went ahead with the shipment anyway. One of the CIA men working with Guillén was Mark McFarlin. In 1989 McFarlin, so he later testified in federal court in Miami, told his CIA station chief in Caracas that the Guillén operation, already under way, had just seen 3,000 pounds of cocaine shipped to the US. When the station chief asked McFarlin if the DEA was aware of this, McFarlin answered no. “Let’s keep it that way,” the station chief instructed him.

Over the next three years, more than 22 tons of cocaine made its way through this pipeline into the US, with the shipments coming into Miami either in hollowed-out shipping pallets or in boxes of blue jeans. In 1990 DEA agents in Caracas learned what was going on, but security was lax since one female DEA agent in Venezuela was sleeping with a CIA man there, and another, reportedly with General Guillén himself. The CIA  and Guillén duly changed their modes of operation, and the cocaine shipments from Caracas to Miami continued for another two years. Eventually, the US Customs Service brought down the curtain on the operation, and in 1992 seized an 800-pound shipment of cocaine in Miami.

One of Guillén’s subordinates, Adolfo Romero, was arrested and ultimately convicted on drug conspiracy charges. None of the Colombian drug lords was ever inconvenienced by this project, despite the CIA’s claim that it was after the Calí cartel. Guillén was indicted but remained safe in Caracas. McFarlin and his boss were ultimately edged out of the Agency. No other heads rolled after an operation that yielded nothing but the arrival, under CIA supervision, of 22 tons of cocaine in the United States. The CIA conducted an internal review of this debacle and asserted that there was “no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.”

A DEA investigation reached a rather different conclusion, charging that the spy agency had engaged in “unauthorized controlled shipments” of narcotics into the US and that the CIA withheld “vital information” on the Calí cartel from the DEA and federal prosecutors. (...(

# U.S. Attorney General William French Smith & Director of CIA William Casey Had a Secret Agreement to NOT Report Drug Crimes by CIA Agents, Assets, Contractors Between 1982-1995. Janet Reno Reversed the Law Because a Reporter Named Gary Webb Began Asking Questions for his story DARK ALLIANCE (1996)

[From 1982 to 1995 the CIA did not to have to report if they suspected any of their agents of dealing drugs. Why?](https://web.archive.org/web/20050420101319/http://www.motherjones.com/commentary/columns/1998/06/cia.html)

It's the kind of government exchange you assume never actually takes place. But it did. And it went something like this:

**CIA Chief:** Dear Attorney General, Do you mind if CIA agents or informants are dealing drugs? I mean, we don't have to tell on them, do we?

**Attorney General:** Of course not! Well, you did. But I just changed the law. Don't worry about it.

**CIA Chief:** Gee, thanks!

This may sound absurd, but according to a series of recently [declassified documents](https://web.archive.org/web/20050420101319/http://www.motherjones.com/sideshow/cia_one.html) obtained by the MoJo Wire, it's just what happened in the spring of 1982.

Letter From Bill Casey To William French Smith

Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey's request to then-Attorney General William French Smith isn't in the public domain. But two letters, one from Smith thanking Casey for his request, and a follow-up by Casey, are both available. They were released as part of a internal CIA report that explored allegations of CIA involvement in drug trafficking. (The most comprehensive allegations were reported by Gary Webb in a series of [*San Jose Mercury News*](https://web.archive.org/web/20050420101319/http://www.sjmercury.com/) reports and a book entitled ""[Dark Alliance](https://web.archive.org/web/20050420101319/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1888363681/themojowireA/)."") In the first document, Smith thanks Casey for his letter (the one that isn't public) and says:

>""...in view of the fine cooperation the Drug Enforcement Administration has received from CIA, no formal requirement regarding the reporting of narcotics violations has been included in these procedures.""--William French SmithAttorney General

Casey in return thanks the Attorney General for his understanding:

>""I am pleased that these procedures, which I believe strike the proper balance between enforcement of the law and protection of intelligence sources and methods, will now be forwarded to other agencies...""--William J. CaseyDirector, Central Intelligence Agency\[[See the full document](https://web.archive.org/web/20050420101319/http://www.motherjones.com/sideshow/cia_two.html)\]

The two men then codified their agreement in a Memorandum of Understanding. According to the agreement, intelligence agencies would not have to report if any of their agents were involved in drug running. (By agents, the agreement meant CIA sources and informants. Full-time employees still couldn't deal drugs.) That understanding remained in effect until August of 1995, when current Attorney General Janet Reno rescinded the agreement.

It's reasonable that the CIA be allowed to keep its mouth shut if it knows that some of its agents are involved in minor illegal affairs. Presumably some of the value of informants comes from the fact that they keep company with shady characters who engage in unlawful activities.

But why would the CIA ask to be exempt specifically from drug enforcement laws? According to Congresswoman [Maxine Waters](https://web.archive.org/web/20050420101319/http://www.house.gov/waters/) (D-Calif.), who is calling for full disclosure of the facts, ""The CIA knew that the Contras were dealing drugs. They made this deal with the Attorney General to protect themselves from having to report it.""

Some of the remaining questions may still be answered. The Department of Justice and the CIA have finished separate investigations into possible CIA involvement in drug smuggling. But neither report has been made available to the public; the Justice department cites an ""ongoing investigation"" while the CIA says their report is an internal document and therefore classified. Says Congresswoman Waters: ""What is it they don't want Americans to see? If the CIA was involved in drug trafficking, they should be brought to justice. Not covered up.""

(...) Excerpt

1967

**Manuel Antonio Noriega goes on the CIA payroll. First recruited by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency in 1959, Noriega becomes an invaluable asset for the CIA when he takes charge of Panama's intelligence service after the 1968 military coup, providing services for U.S. covert operations and facilitating the use of Panama as the center of U.S. intelligence gathering in Latin America. In 1976, CIA Director George Bush pays Noriega $110,000 for his services, even though as early as 1971 U.S. officials agents had evidence that he was deeply involved in drug trafficking. Although the Carter administration suspends payments to Noriega, he returns to the U.S. payroll when President Reagan takes office in 1981. The general is rewarded handsomely for his services in support of Contras forces in Nicaragua during the 1980s, collecting $200,000 from the CIA in 1986 alone.**

(...)

JUNE 1975

**Mexican police, assisted by U.S. drug agents, arrest Alberto Sicilia Falcon, whose Tijuana-based operation was reportedly generating $3.6 million a week from the sale of cocaine and marijuana in the United States. The Cuban exile claims he was a CIA protege, trained as part of the agency's anti-Castro efforts, and in exchange for his help in moving weapons to certain groups in Central America, the CIA facilitated his movement of drugs. In 1974, Sicilia's top aide, Jose Egozi, a CIA-trained intelligence officer and Bay of Pigs veteran, reportedly lined up agency support for a right-wing plot to overthrow the Portuguese government. Among the top Mexican politicians, law enforcement and intelligence officials from whom Sicilia enjoyed support was Miguel Nazar Haro, head of the Direccion Federal de Seguridad (DFS), who the CIA admits was its \`most important source in Mexico and Central America.' When Nazar was linked to a multi-million-dollar stolen car ring several years later, the CIA intervenes to prevent his indictment in the United States.**

(...)

FEBRUARY 1985

**DEA agent Enrique \`Kiki' Camerena is kidnapped and murdered in Mexico. DEA, FBI and U.S. Customs Service investigators accuse the CIA of stonewalling during their investigation. U.S. authorities claim the CIA is more interested in protecting its assets, including top drug trafficker and kidnapping principal Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo. (In 1982, the DEA learned that Felix Gallardo was moving $20 million a month through a single Bank of America account, but it could not get the CIA to cooperate with its investigation.) Felix Gallardo's main partner is Honduran drug lord Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, who began amassing his $2-billion fortune as a cocaine supplier to Alberto Sicilia Falcon. (see June 1985) Matta's air transport firm, SETCO, receives $186,000 from the U.S. State Department to fly \`humanitarian supplies' to the Nicaraguan Contras from 1983 to 1985. Accusations that the CIA protected some of Mexico's leading drug traffickers in exchange for their financial support of the Contras are leveled by government witnesses at the trials of Camarena's accused killers.**

NOVEMBER 1996

Former head of the Venezuelan National Guard and CIA operative Gen. Ramon Gullien Davila is indicted in Miami on charges of smuggling as much as 22 tons of cocaine into the United States. More than a ton of cocaine was shipped into the country with the CIA's approval as part of an undercover program aimed at catching drug smugglers, an operation kept secret from other U.S. agencies. (Watch the 60 Minutes video. The head of the DEA turns in the C.I.A.)

# On March 22, 1988, The US DOJ (Associate Attorney General Stephen S. Trott ) notified the office of  Independent Counsel that an informant named PAUL ALLEN RUDD met with PABLO ESCOBAR and that an exchange of guns for drugs had occurred with the contras.  The informant said that ESCOBAR was dealing with a US government agency. See the documents here:

Rudd says that Escobar complained that George Bush Used to deal with him, But was now being tough. He claimed to have a photo of Bush with Jorge Ochoa, another cartel member. ESCOBAR stated that guns were unloaded and cocaine was sent to US military bases.

The Associate Attorney General vouches for the reliability of the informant as he has provided reliable information until this point.

Media Censor CIA Ties With Medellin Drug Cartel

[http://web.archive.org/web/20120908153238/http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1190](http://web.archive.org/web/20120908153238/http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1190)

The Washington Post (2/12/88) included this politically delicate aspect of Rodriguez's testimony in its headline: ""Drug Money Alleged to Go to Contras."" But Joe Pichirallo's page 30 article tiptoed around CIA involvement with Rodriguez. The Post also failed to mention Rodriguez's assertion that he worked with US banks, and it did not include his statement about laundering moneyfor the CIA after his drug indictment. This omission was egregious in view of the fact that Senator Kerry questioned Rodriguez in detail about an accounting sheet which a federal prosecutor submitted as evidence at his trail:

Senator Kerry: What does your accounting show with respect to the CIA?

Ramon Rodriguez: It shows that I received a shipment of three million and change sometime in the middle of the month. [(Watch the video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPpEqF_51sw)

At the end of the hearing the Post's Pichirallo asked chief counsel Jack Blum why the CIA would use Rodriguez to funnel money after he'd been indicted. Blum responded that such a time would be ideal, since US government investigators cannot approach a defendant after he has been indicted. Extra! later asked Pichirallo why Rodriguez's testimony about moving dirty money for the CIA was excluded from the Post, but he was not forthcoming: ""It is my policy never to discuss anything I do.""

(Ramon Rodriguez mentions that he also paid the Watergate burglars earlier in his career, but Senator Kerry doesn't ask further questions.)

[http://ncoic.com/deajive.htm](http://ncoic.com/deajive.htm)

I've been threatened throughout my life, but one of the scariest threats that I've ever had came in the form of advice from a friend of mine in DEA who is now one of the high level people in DEA. He called me during the hottest part of their investigation into me when I was criticizing the government. To fully understand what he said I need to tell a quick little story.

Sandy (Sante) Bario was DEA agent who was sent to Mexico. I considered him one of the top undercover agents in DEA. He became involved in all kinds of CIA type operations with drugs and eventually ended up being arrested while smuggling drugs. I won't even comment on whether he became corrupt or whether the whole system is so corrupt that no one can go into it without becoming corrupt.

Sandy was being held in a jail on the Texas-Mexican border when he took a bite of a peanut butter sandwich in the jail. He fell down in convulsions and went into a coma. The initial tests indicated that Sandy had been poisoned with strychnine. He died three or four weeks later and the final autopsy said death by asphyxiation on a peanut butter sandwich, he choked on the sandwich.  
That's incredible.

Half the DEA agents I knew believed that he was either offed by some covert agency in the government or possibly some elements within DEA. I didn't want to believe anything like that, I couldn't believe anything like that.

Cut to several years later, and here I am under investigation, criticizing my own government, and a DEA official calls me and says, ""Mike I like you. Remember a peanut butter sandwich?"". ""Are you kidding?"", I said, and he replied, ""Not at all, I'm only telling you this because I like you""' and he and I never spoke again.",shylock92008,8

Bill Clinton was tied to it when he was governor and the CIA flew drugs into a Mena Arkansas airport. And once that has happened, the connection is never erased. He and Hillary are dirty as hell and that part of the CIA still runs errands for them. I expect including a number of 'suicides' of people with dirt on the Clintons.  So this all runs far deeper than just Iran Contra and guns. And of course George Bush was in it up to his neck too in different ways.

I remember when Gary Webb was doing his reporting. He was local to me.  And undoubtedly the CIA suicided him in his tub for causing so much news coverage but made it look like an act of depression. It's all about the Benjamins.",DZP,12

The exit for your VPN is still accessing the webpages normally then sending the data to you encrypted.  If the exit node is on an account tied to you, your ISP or host can still see what you're browsing.

The benefit of a public VPN is that only their host or ISP can see your browsing data but they have no way of tying it to you/it gets buried in the data of hundreds of other users.

Something like Hyperboria or TOR is preferred but they have performance issues and there's still ways to track users by using various applet exploits or tying trends together to piece together your identity (see recent take downs of major TOR sites).

TOR on public WiFi (Starbucks or something) on a stripped browser (basically only loads text) with a random or disposable MAC address on a live disk (that's cycled often) is the most secure you can get for staying anonymous.

You really don't need a setup like that though unless you're some huge drug kingpin or a political target.  It's a pretty big pain in the ass when a public VPN will suffice for most things.  Even if they keep logs it's pretty unlikely you'll be targeted unless you're doing something insanely illegal and are making a ton of money off it.

I had recurring nightmares about the end of the world.  In my youth, I spent a little time in West Germany - a highly militarized place at the time because everyone's estimates placed the East/West Germany divide as the most obvious flashpoint for WWIII.

In the U.S., my government told me how horrible and evil the Soviet Union was.  I bought it, because most of it was actually true - it was not a benevolent government. They mentioned the Soviet economy occasionally, but there were many poor countries in the world, so that wasn't the big gripe.

I clearly recall the main reasons my beloved U.S. government gave to hate the Soviet government and feel pity for the Soviet people:

> The Soviets are victims who have no real control over their government when it counts.

> The Soviets' correspondences and phone calls are constantly monitored.

> The Soviets' movements are constantly tracked.

> There are some people in Soviet society that ""have it all"", and the others just suffer.  Their government taunts them with a false hope of upward mobility ""Stick with us.  One day things will get better for you! &lt;snicker>""

> The Soviet government treats its citizens like subjects, like idiotic children in need of control and restriction, worse yet, like animals on a farm.  They sneer at their citizens and feel the inborn right to lead them.

These were truly **THE** main reasons given to hate the Soviet government, and to pity the ""misled and abused Soviet people"".  I honestly can't find anything in these main points that does not apply to the U.S. government at present.

If you were to describe the 2013 United States to 14 year old me, I guarantee I would have thought you were talking about the future Soviets.  A nation of smug leaders duping the public.  People at the top clawing all the wealth and resources out of the hands of the rest.  A government watching your every move and listening to your private conversations and thoughts.

14-year-old me would just assume that in the future the Soviet economy just gradually got a bit better, but everything else stayed the same or got worse.",well_golly,634

No that's not what happened at all. The deal with Lavabit was that they were trying to look at a specific person's email (probably Snowden's) but since it was encrypted all the metadata they collected was basically useless. They then got a warrant to wiretap that specific email but also requested the encryption keys so they could actually read what the emails said.

    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:

    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**
       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month.
       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS.
       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote.
    2. **Weighted Votes:**
       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance).
       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0).
       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight).
    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**
       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count.
       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments.
    4. **Transparency:**
       * Tip records will look like this:

          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`

    **Guidelines:**

    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation.
    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially.
    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action.

    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀",donut-bot,1

Other people on these markets buy these documents and then use the information in hopes of logging into bank accounts and steal money from people and do other things with online accounts.

These documents get old over time and become more available and sites like this are able to read them and then make their own lists based on emails of who’s had their info leaked.

This is why people recommend to not reuse the same password. Because once a hacker has your Yahoo email and password, they will then start going around trying to use that same login information elsewhere.

There are one time passcodes you can save to get you back into your accounts. LastPass has a backup to cloud but that concept seems sketchy to me 

The reason I say this is because if you do 2FA properly then it will not be possible to send an SMS code to unlock, which means if you upgrade your phone for example and forget to backup your codes you will get permanently locked out of those accounts

Ask me how I know, lol. 

Also, interestingly, fucking this up can shed some light on the security of the apps you are using. I had 2FA on some health/fitness app, and forgot to back it up, couldn’t get access, emailed support and they unlocked my account, WTF

So now I’m making a habit of pretending I lost my 2FA on my important accounts and seeing if I can get back into them through support, if you can then it’s pointless because the hackers can just unlock your account however the support team is doing it

You should have different email address. For example one for important services (bank, exchanges etc) or even one for each entity. 
You can then use other mails for less important stuff and a third one for useless sites that still requires you to provide a mIl or something.

Using a password manager (with the same rules as above) is also a good idea. You'll have different password for each site and secure password.

Using 2FA is also extremely recommended. To login into my bank account I need to confirm with my sms/mail/authenticator. 

Mail and phone 2fa are less secure that Google or Microsoft authenticator, that's something to remember. The best is sill to have a dedicated device. (Old phone or even a USB key you have to plug in). Make sure you have duplicate to avoid losing it.",Reanga87,2

My understanding of them is you plug them in, place your finger down and it does stuff which somehow makes you login ...or something.

You set it up the same as another 2FA method so that it creates a new 6 digit code every time you log in. 

With the sites that have it integrated, all you have to do is plug it in and it automatically gives the 1 time unique code to the site to allow login. With sites that don’t have it integrated, you’ll plug it into the app which then gives you a 1 time code to use within like 30 seconds. 

Not sure if that helps explain any better, but I hope that makes sense. I can try to find a better way to explain it later if you are still having trouble. It took me awhile to figure it out too.",five-methoxy,3

**New Voting and Reward System**
 
To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:
 
1. **Upvoting with Tips:**
   * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month.
   * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS.
   * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote.
2. **Weighted Votes:**
   * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance).
   * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0).
   * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight).
3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**
   * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count.
   * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments.
4. **Transparency:**
   * Tip records will look like this:
 
      `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`
 
**Guidelines:**
 
* Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation.
* As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially.
* Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action.
 
Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀",donut-bot,1

Does eating a baby monkey every 7 years take away from the fact that he's saved the planet countless times? Is it the action itself that people are upset by, or is it merely that the *idea* of Superman is tarnished by the innate shortcomings of the human mind? Superman is seen as the figure of perfect altruism and justice, always putting the needs of others in front of his own. I think that the consumption of a baby monkey reels people back into reality, the reality that nobody can be perfect and there is always a cost for everything, which is understandably a depressing reality. It is crucial to realize though.

I think its important to understand that good people are still just people, and they should be judged by the merit of their character in conjunction with their deeds. John Kennedy's addiction to sex doesn't take away from his ambition during his time as president.",Sgt_Dankster,293

Abstaining from animal products isn't just consumer activism(which is obviously ineffective for change, systemic action must be taken), it is also a choice to recognize that it isn't our right to turn animals, who are fully sentient, feeling, emotional beings, into product.

You see, a baby cow that is allowed to roam around exercises it's muscles, which makes the meat less tender, so confining them is necessary for the most expensive veal (as it is most tender).

Additionally, they are given little to no iron in their diets. I believe PETA or some other animal rights org petitioned in the 80s or 90s for a minimum amount of needed iron (I'm at work I can't fact check this right now, I read about it in Animal Liberation by Peter Singer).

Before this change, baby cows were so restricted from iron that they would lick the bars of their cage to get some. So what did farmers do? They made new cages without iron.

What could they be doing that caused such deformation? I watched as it stuck out one limb. The end of which being covered in ridged tentacles, as if to make a mockery of my form. The beast gurgled something incomplete, as another of their forms moved over to the water. It was beckoning me. It's done this before. It pulls me from my small world to the surface, putting me back after awhile. I don't know what it does to my world, but it replaces anything it takes. Like a trade. So again, I moved atop this mockery of my form. It's flesh made mine squirm. It's eyes followed my every move for awhile. Until I was thrust back into my own world. I looked around the changed landscape, hoping everything stayed the same. In place of my home, a new structure stood. Something that almost resembled the twisted form of the beast above, yet was so distinctly not. I cautiously moved toward it, encouraged by the calls from above, and made myself a comfortable abode.

""What are those- things? They were like nothing she had ever seen. Very tall and slender, like reeds. They moved with blinding speed, in a strange, jerky motion that she found hard to follow. 

Before she could register anything else, she saw one of the demons spring toward caravan guard. The guard was crouched, holding up her fork and flail in trembling palps, whistling with terror. In a movement faster than anything Nukurren had ever seen, the demon thrust forth some sort of huge stinger. As the stinger hurtled at the guard, Nukurren saw a brief gleam from its tip. Metal! But what kind of metal shines gray? The stinger plunged deeply into the camp guard's head, right between the eyes and into the brain. The guard died instantly, without a sound. 

The demon planted a-a ped? wondered Nukurren; was that long and skinny thing a ped?-onto the dead guard's head and wrenched the stinger loose with its two tentacles, Except they're not tentacles. They're like sticks tied together. And that stinger's a weapon of some kind, That last thought restored her courage. They might be demons, but if they needed weapons they had to be vulnerable. Somehow She had no more time for thought.From the corner of her eye she caught a flickering motion. Then the gleam of a weapon coming straight toward her. She was totally unprepared for a straight-thrusting weapon. No gukuy could deliver such a blow. But she instantly raised the shield protecting her palp on the crossbar of the fork, in the reflex of a fighter fending off blowpipe darts.""",Yananiris,18

1). Adani won a few solar contracts in India.  
2). Now Adani needs funds to fulfill these projects.  
3). He raised $3Bn from US markets through Bonds.

Now here comes the full picture.

*A Group of people filed a case against Adani in the US*  
Why? - Accusation that he bribed Indian Officials. He bribed $250Mn (2000 Crores) to get these contracts.

**But why a case in the US for bribery in India?**

(**A**). The bribery was never disclosed to US investors while raising funds.  
(**B**). This is equal to ""Deceiving US investors""  
(**C**). Most Critical: SEC (US equivalent of SEBI) has also accused Adani of the same.

What's next now? The Possible Impact!

\- Difficulty in raising funds from the US for future projects.  
\- Legal Battle in the US can go extremely brutal.  
\- Increased Internation Scrutiny for Indian businesses from now onwards.

Since a lot of money directly or indirectly gets loaned to Adani, there will be an outsized impact on government too. 

1) Credit agencies downgrade: As credit agencies downgrade Adani it will become difficult for Adani & Cos to raise fund domestically and internationally both

2) Green projects: Since a lot of green projects are also linked to carbon credit market, a tarnish of Cos image can probably get them kicked out of international green credit market. Moreover, government lending on behalf of green projects will also get impacted.

3) Port business: Dealing with an indicted company is a big deal esp for EU, ANZ, US based companies significantly curtailing its business domestically and abroad. Given Adani is largest private holder of ports, government will have to figure out a way to channel the traffic to other legitimate firms

Basically any money or loans which are connected to US/EU market, IMF, Private Equity, etc either loaned to the Indian government or Adani will be impacted.",MrLovaLovaAO,85

I’m in Europe and didn’t realize the US had their time change. I just sat down to organize my research and the bell rang. I was flustered to say the least. I have a 10% rule and I’ve tried to really stick with it. But several times last week (in a very similar situation with a catalyst like this) I sold and then saw the price rebound and climb the next day. It’s tough. I feel like at this point I can pick winning stocks which is an improvement over following someone else’s watchlist fairly accurately but my entry points are just ridiculous.  And I pass on stocks (looking at you SGLB) thinking they’ve already run and I could have squeezed 2 or more dollars out them. EYES has had an awesome bounce each day I’ve been too timid to jump into.  It’s tough. I’m sticking to small investments until I can show some regular success.  While I do feel frustration I also know I’m learning. For example I was able to stop myself from making a revenge buy to try to recoup my losses 😁.

When volatility dies down, this won’t be worth doing at all IMO, since there are way better securities to run credit spreads on.

The trick is to get the spreads filled as wide as possible, with the ultimate goal of getting the same amount of premium as the the difference in strikes. With meme stocks volatility, this makes it significantly easier to get those perfect “infinite” money $5.00/$10.00 spreads but it doesn’t always happen (well technically I only had one filled and it was $2.50 for 182.5c/185c for last week, but you can get pretty close). It’s very important that you have to know if and when to bounce. Typically algos pickup on these infinite money spreads pretty quickly, so on all of these you basically have to leg into them one at a time which not everybody can do (if you can’t sell naked calls/puts then unfortunately, you can’t realistically do this).

The gotcha is that if you lose, well you lose hard and fast, so it kinda goes against the typical theta gang “set it and forget” types of plays.",mdbarney,4

My best play was 100x 182.5c/185c 5/21 that got filled for a spread of $2.50. There is low volume on the $2.5 intervals so it’s very unlikely to get a fill for them.

I’d try to stick to the $5/$10 strikes if you can handle putting that much collateral on the line.",mdbarney,5

I managed to do this once by buying the long call during an intraday crash and then selling the short once it bounced a bit. Got 130% of the spread as premium. But I only did it that one time because basically it amounts to going long delta while you hope for that bounce. If it had continued to tank, I would’ve vaporized a lot of money.

When it really gets down to it, it takes just as much effort to sell calls or puts and just buy them back cheaper the second it drops (so basically scalping). I have some python scripts/macros I run to leg into the positions to minimize losses when I can’t just set a spread.

The reason spreads have been my play is it allows me a fuck ton of leverage without having to put up nearly as much collateral, still risky plays. If I’m wrong, it will definitely hurt",mdbarney,1

Yeah man, happy to help. Just remember that you will never find the spread amount exactly the same as the difference between the strike prices since if they ever exist (even with volatility), algos will get them.

To really get the spreads like that you have to leg in (which I did in that spread), and if you can predict the movement of the stock like that, you’ll still be successful just scalping calls/puts. 

I do it solely for the amount of leverage I can utilize.

Also keep in mind, credit spreads like that (with that much leverage) can obliterate your portfolio very very quickly, so please please please be careful and don’t do anything crazy levered until you get the hang of it.",mdbarney,2

A couple outcomes I see,  MARA runs past strike and you booked your loss. Or it tanks another 50%, IV will crash and break even will be in summer 2024. 


>go back to pltr puts..

Selling puts, that is plain stupid use of capital on a great company.  I own LEAPS and sell CCs.  Up on LEAPS and premiums are great.  If it's back to 30 by next summer it will be a very nice payday.

Their interface and order types suck so bad, and I'm so risk averse, that I just sell to open and then immediately send a buy to close GTC order at the profit point I'm currently comfortable with. I monitor and adjust as often as possible, but I don't *have* to and that's why I do it.

If you're not PDT limited and have a better broker you can combine all sorts of toys - OCO brackets with any combination of buys, stop / stop limits, trailing stop / stop limits, fancy triggers on top of all that, etc. Of course if you are PDT limited, just wait a day to send the closing order set.

Market volatility + unpredictably wide spreads make this almost never as optimal as actually watching L2 data as it happens, but that requires.. you know, actually watching L2 data as it happens and doing a bunch of calculations while numbers fly by. Lots of emotion in the midst of all that activity!

My most active trade at the moment is selling and buying back covered calls on some MARA I didn't monitor. My second most ""active"" trade is staring at the RIOT put I sold @ 40 strike and didn't pay attention to for way too long. No real way to rescue that one now - just riding it out and hoping IV stays high after I get assigned.

TLDR: Consider setting profit / loss targets every time you enter a trade, setup your order(s) to automate that as much as possible (keep in mind all of your various account restrictions), then adjust at an interval that works for you and your account.",mmolesy,4

In a bullish or neutral environment you will keep the premium, and on the bullish side you are giving up the upside potential. 

If you are bearish on the stock in the short-run, puts can be great paired with a long underlying position if you would be happy to own the stock at the strike less the premium. 

Essentially if I own 1000 shares of ABC trading at $50, and idk if it will go up or down in 3 months, but I would be happy to own it at $40 given good long-run expectations for the firm, I could sell a cash-secured put with a strike of $43, keep the $3 premium, and I will break even if it drops to $40. If it trades sideways or jumps I just keep the premium.

- delta < .3 can act as a rough estimate of probability of expiring ITM so ~30% of not getting the full sale price at the end of the contract. Although this is a rule of thumb and I don’t fully understand why the math sort of works out... if you look at ITM prob on TOS you will find it tends to diverge from delta by 5-10 percentage points
- yield is 3.5% per month: this means if you sell a put for $3.50 then you’ll have to put up $100 cash to secure that put for a month.

In theory this combination is not super aggressive and not super conservative in my personal opinion, at least in the market environment we’ve been in over the last year. But it is pretty aggressive over the long term of course since you don’t make 100% annually without exposure to risk.
